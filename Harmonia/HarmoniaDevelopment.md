  - Result handling and error management

### 4. Event System

- **Event Definitions**
  - Standard event format
  - Event metadata and payload
  - Event correlation
  
- **Event Triggers**
  - Workflow initiation from events
  - Mid-workflow event handling
  - Event generation during execution
  
- **Event Subscriptions**
  - Component-specific subscriptions

   - Subscription to external events
   - Message bus integration

### Phase 5: Advanced Features

1. **Dynamic Workflows**
   - Runtime workflow modification
   - Dynamic task creation
   - Adaptive execution paths

2. **Distributed Execution**
   - Worker-based execution
   - Distributed state management
   - Cross-instance coordination

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Detailed execution metrics
   - Performance monitoring
   - Alerting on issues

## Technical Considerations

### Workflow Definition Format

Workflows will be defined using a declarative format with:

- Clear separation of workflow structure and task details
- Support for variables and expressions
- Extensibility for future patterns
- Versioning for compatibility

Example:
```yaml
name: document_processing
version: 1.0
description: Process and analyze documents
input:
  document_path:
    type: string
    description: Path to document
tasks:
  extract_text:
    component: ergon
    action: extract_text_from_document
    input:
      document_path: ${input.document_path}
  analyze_sentiment:
    component: sophia
    action: analyze_sentiment
    input:
      text: ${tasks.extract_text.output.text}
    depends_on:
      - extract_text
output:
  sentiment: ${tasks.analyze_sentiment.output.sentiment}
  text: ${tasks.extract_text.output.text}
```

### State Management

The state management system will be built on:

- SQLAlchemy for database abstraction
- JSON serialization for state storage
- Optimistic locking for concurrent updates
- Periodic snapshots for efficiency

### Component Integration

Components will be integrated through:

- Standardized task format
- Well-defined input/output mappings
- Clear error reporting
- Timeouts and cancelation support

### API Design

The API will provide:

- Workflow CRUD operations
- Execution control (start, pause, resume, cancel)
- State inspection and modification
- Event publication and subscription

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient state serialization
- Minimizing database operations
- Task batching where appropriate
- Resource pooling for external components
- Caching frequently used resources

## Security Considerations

- Authentication for sensitive operations
- Validation of workflow definitions
- Secure storage of sensitive state
- Access control for workflow execution
- Audit logging for all state changes

## Integration Strategy

Harmonia will integrate with other Tekton components through:

1. **Hermes Integration**
   - Event publication and subscription
   - Message-based task delegation
   - Service discovery

2. **Ergon Integration**
   - Agent task execution
   - Tool invocation
   - Result handling

3. **Athena Integration**
   - Knowledge retrieval during workflows
   - Context enrichment
   - Decision support

4. **Other Components**
   - Standardized task interface
   - Component-specific adapters
   - Dynamic capability discovery

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for Harmonia development are:

1. Implement the core workflow representation
2. Create the basic execution engine
3. Develop the state tracking system
4. Build component integration framework
5. Create simple workflows for testing
