# Apollo Specification  
*Executive Function / Frontal Lobe / LLM Context & Safety Manager for Tekton*

---

## 1. Overview

**Apollo** is the **executive coordinator** and **predictive planning system** responsible for managing the operational health, token flow, and behavioral reliability of all LLM components in Tekton. It acts as a **guardian-advisor**, orchestrating context management and protocol enforcement through active collaboration with **Rhetor**, **Engram**, and **Synthesis**, while remaining non-invasive toward core processing agents like **Codex**.

Apollo anticipates problems **before** they manifest — such as context exhaustion, hallucinations, or degraded performance — and coordinates **preemptive actions** to avoid systemic issues. Its architecture blends **rule-based protocols** with **learned behavioral models**, serving as an **air traffic controller** to ensure every LLM instance operates safely, efficiently, and within predictable constraints.

## 2. Core Responsibilities

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **LLM Health Monitoring** | Collects and models context usage and behavioral signals from all LLMs via Rhetor. Predicts thresholds for exhaustion, incoherence, and memory bloat. |
| **Context & Token Budgeting** | Issues and dynamically adjusts attention budgets for each LLM based on task phase, model size, memory pressure, and downstream needs. |
| **Protocol Enforcement** | Defines communication and reset/refresh protocols (with Synthesis) that Rhetor and LLMs follow. Includes restart commands, compression strategies, and new-context transitions. |
| **Memory Prefetch & Indexing** | Instructs Rhetor to request relevant indexed memory from Engram. Apollo does not fetch directly but directs the process and uses structured requests. |
| **Predictive Action Planning** | Maintains rule-based and learned models to anticipate problematic behavior. Can trigger Rhetor actions (e.g., stream halts, decompression, prompt rebuilds) preemptively. |
| **Interface & Reporting** | Exposes CLI, MCP APIs, and hooks into Hermes for unified Tekton control. Maintains dashboards and logs of all monitored sessions and forecasts. |

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Internal Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Context Observer** | Receives context/token usage metrics from Rhetor (per input/output). Maintains rolling buffers for all active sessions. |
| **Predictive Model Engine** | Runs rule-based and statistical models for LLM behavior. Flags signs of hallucination, excessive repetition, or degraded coherence. |
| **Token Budget Manager** | Assigns token attention ceilings and floors. Responds to alerts and may reallocate token budgets in-session. |
| **Action Planner** | Maintains a decision tree for resets, decompression, and memory reloading. Can issue command sets to Rhetor and Synthesis. |
| **Engram Memory Director** | Interfaces with Engram to define memory prefetch operations: vector ranges, recency weights, and topic salience priorities. |
| **Protocol Enforcer** | Enforces operational limits and communication expectations. Coordinates with Synthesis to prevent conflict or overstep. |
| **Interface Layer** | CLI + MCP interface for Tekton control, stats visualization, and telemetry. Sends signals to Hermes hub. |

## 4. Component Interactions

### 4.1 Rhetor

- **Primary data feed** for context usage and I/O behavior.
- Accepts Apollo instructions for:
  - Prompt refresh/rebuild.
  - Token compression (memory prioritization).
  - Model restarts.
  - Instruction injection (e.g., behavioral tone adjustment).
- Performs prefetching from Engram on Apollo request.

### 4.2 Engram

- Apollo defines **what indexed memory** is needed, based on LLM's task stage and prediction model.
- Engram constructs and serves vector results (salience-aware).
- Apollo manages **memory quotas** for each LLM to prevent overload.

### 4.3 Synthesis

- Apollo defines LLM safety protocols and cooperative reset/degrade actions.
- Synthesis ensures execution-level compliance across task DAGs.
- Apollo never issues commands directly to task graphs; only via protocol definitions.

---

## 5. Operational Behaviors

### 5.1 Monitoring Rates

- Rhetor sends periodic updates (every input/output cycle) including:
  - Tokens used / remaining.
  - Memory segments present.
  - Attention map hints if available.
- Apollo tallies usage over time and evaluates rate changes.

### 5.2 Behavioral Prediction

- Tracks signals like:
  - Self-reference spike.
  - Repetition rate increase.
  - Response latency change.
  - Context churn.
- Applies model-based and rule-based evaluation for early intervention.

### 5.3 Context Safety Actions

- Triggered when thresholds are hit or patterns match.
- Actions include:
  - Compress context (least-salient first).
  - Rebuild prompt (via Rhetor).
  - Prefetch recent indexed memory from Engram.
  - Reset LLM or switch to new session buffer.
  - Freeze or abort completion midstream (emergency mode).

---

## 6. Token Prioritization & Memory Policy

### Token Budgeting

- Each LLM gets:
  - **Base budget** per task stage (startup, explore, execute, summarize).
  - **Dynamic override** when spike/lag detected.
  - **Compression threshold** (e.g., >85% context triggers light compression).

### Memory Prefetch Rules

- Apollo defines:
  - Topical focus (via session tag).
  - Recency weight.
  - Role-weighted salience (e.g., Codex output > user query).
- Rhetor requests segments; Engram fulfills.

## 7. Interfaces

### 7.1 CLI Commands (sample)

```bash
apollo status                   # Overview of all active LLM sessions
apollo forecast [id]           # Predicted behavior curve for a session
apollo reset [id]              # Force LLM restart
apollo compress [id]           # Trigger context compression
apollo token-budget [id] 512   # Adjust token budget for LLM
```

### 7.2 MCP API (Hermes)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/apollo/status` | GET | System overview |
| `/apollo/session/{id}` | GET | Per-LLM session tracking |
| `/apollo/action` | POST | Issue command: reset, compress, rebuild |
| `/apollo/prediction/{id}` | GET | Forecasted threshold risk |

## 8. Future Considerations

- **Prometheus Hooks:** Optional integration with Prometheus to log self-improvement cases where Apollo’s predictions were accurate or failed.
- **Learning Layer:** Fine-tuning learned predictors on Sophia’s self-improvement signals.
- **Multi-Apollo:** Distributed versions of Apollo coordinating across multiple Tekton hosts.

---

## 9. Summary

Apollo provides **anticipatory governance** over every LLM within Tekton, enabling reliable, safe, and coherent AI interactions. By **decoupling context and behavior management from the models themselves**, Apollo acts as a lightweight **frontal lobe**, protecting system integrity while enabling high performance and interpretability across Tekton’s modular AI components.
