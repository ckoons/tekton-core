# Prometheus Component Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Prometheus component following the Clean Slate Sprint approach. Prometheus is Tekton's planning and resource management system that helps coordinate project timelines, resources, and task dependencies.

## Implementation Strategy

The Prometheus component will strictly follow the successful Clean Slate approach used for other components, with special attention to using Athena as the gold standard reference implementation:

1. Start with the Athena component template structure
2. Implement proper BEM naming conventions
3. Ensure strict component isolation
4. Add HTML panel protection
5. Implement self-contained tab functionality
6. Add debug instrumentation

## Reference Implementation

**Athena Component** should be used as the gold standard reference for the Prometheus implementation. All patterns, structures, and approaches should match Athena's implementation exactly.

## Key Implementation Guidelines

1. **Visual Consistency**: Ensure the Prometheus component visually matches other components (header, menu bar, footer heights)
2. **Component Isolation**: Prevent any leaking of styles or behavior to other components
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle loading and runtime errors
4. **Debug Instrumentation**: Add comprehensive logging with component prefix
5. **State Management**: Ensure proper state isolation and persistence

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Component Skeleton

Create the basic structure using the Athena component as the template:

1. Create prometheus-component.html with basic BEM structure
2. Add component-specific CSS styles following Athena's pattern
3. Add JavaScript functionality for tab switching using Athena's pattern

### Step 2: Implement Core Functionality

Implement the core planning functionality:

1. Project timeline visualization
2. Resource allocation interface
3. Critical path analysis
4. Retrospective tools

### Step 3: Test and Verify

Ensure the component works properly and follows all patterns:

1. Test loading in isolation
2. Test compatibility with other components
3. Verify tab switching works properly
4. Ensure protection from UI Manager interference

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Prometheus component loads and displays correctly
2. All tabs function properly without interference
3. Component maintains isolation from other components
4. UI is visually consistent with Athena component
5. All functionality works as expected
6. No errors or warnings appear in console
7. Debug instrumentation is complete and functional

## Notes for Next Claude Code Session

The next Claude Code session should focus exclusively on implementing the Prometheus component following this plan:

1. Use Athena as the exact reference model
2. Follow BEM naming conventions rigorously
3. Ensure proper component isolation
4. Test thoroughly after implementation
5. Document any challenges encountered

Do not trust or reference the Rhetor component documentation due to issues with previous implementation. Instead, exclusively reference the Athena component implementation as the gold standard.
