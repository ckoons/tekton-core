# Clean Slate Sprint

## Overview

The Clean Slate Sprint focuses on rebuilding the Tekton UI component architecture with an emphasis on reliability, maintainability, and proper isolation. This sprint addresses persistent issues encountered in previous UI implementation efforts by establishing strict patterns, clear component boundaries, and methodical development procedures.

## Sprint Documents

The following documents define this sprint:

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): Outlines the high-level goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Documents key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Provides detailed implementation tasks and phases
- [Clean Slate UI Implementation](CleanSlateUIImplementation.md): Documents the component architecture and implementation patterns
- [Ergon Component Migration](ErgonComponentMigration.md): Details the migration of the Ergon component to the Clean Slate architecture
- [Summary](Summary.md): Final summary of sprint achievements and lessons learned

## Sprint Branch

This sprint uses the branch `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125`.

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Strict Component Isolation**: Components operate only within their own container without affecting others
2. **Template-Based Development**: All components follow the same basic template and patterns
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality is implemented and validated before adding features
4. **Clear Contracts**: Well-defined interfaces between components and the main UI
5. **Methodical Implementation**: Changes are incremental and validated at each step

## Sprint Completion

**May 15, 2025**: The Clean Slate Sprint has been successfully completed! All primary planned components have been implemented following the Clean Slate architecture principles:

- **Tekton Core** implementation is now complete. The component has been fully implemented as the final component in this sprint, following the Clean Slate architecture principles:
  - Six panel structure: Projects, Repositories, Branches, Actions, Project Chat, and Team Chat
  - GitHub project management functionality
  - Repository and branch management
  - BEM naming conventions with proper isolation
  - Self-contained tab functionality
  - UI Manager and HTML panel protection
  - GitHub service integration
  - Project Manager functionality

- **Prometheus** implementation is complete. The component has been fully implemented following the Clean Slate architecture principles:
  - BEM naming conventions
  - Component isolation 
  - Self-contained tab functionality
  - Debug instrumentation
  - Timeline visualization
  - Planning features

- **Rhetor** implementation is complete, with proper adherence to the Athena reference implementation.

- **Athena**, **Ergon**, **Hermes**, and **Engram** components have all been successfully migrated to the Clean Slate architecture.

The **Budget**, **Profile**, and **Settings** footer components were not included in this sprint and are planned for future implementation.

See the [Summary](Summary.md) document for a comprehensive overview of the sprint achievements, lessons learned, and next steps.

## Working Guidelines for Development Sessions

For Claude Code sessions and development work during this sprint, follow these guidelines:

1. **Validate Branch First**: Always verify you're working on the correct branch before making changes
    ```bash
    git branch
    # Should show you are on sprint/Clean_Slate_051125
    ```

2. **Start Simple**: Focus on basic functionality before adding complexity
    - First make sure component loads correctly
    - Then add basic interactivity
    - Add more advanced features only after basics work

3. **Commit at Stable Points**: Create commits whenever you reach a stable point
    - Commit after component loads correctly
    - Commit after basic interactivity works
    - Commit after each feature is added

4. **Follow Established Patterns**: 
    - Use BEM naming for CSS: `.component__element--modifier`
    - Follow the lifecycle pattern in JS: `init()`, `activate()`, `cleanup()`
    - Match the HTML structure from the golden template

5. **Test Before Moving On**:
    - Verify component loads without errors
    - Check that styles apply correctly and don't leak
    - Confirm behavior matches expectations

6. **Documentation**:
    - Update documentation alongside code changes
    - Document any challenges or decisions made
    - Create examples for future reference
