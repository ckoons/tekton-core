# MCP Unified Integration - Initial Status Report

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Name:** MCP Unified Integration
**Date:** 2025-05-07
**Current Phase:** Planning
**Branch:** sprint/mcp-unified-integration-250507

## Current Status

The MCP Unified Integration Sprint is currently in the planning phase. Key documents have been created, including:

- Sprint Plan
- Architectural Decisions
- Implementation Plan
- Claude Code Prompt

The sprint branch has been created, and implementation will begin shortly.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Core MCP Implementation and Registration
2. Set up development environment and verify correct branch
3. Understand existing MCP implementation across components
4. Implement FastMCP integration in tekton-core
5. Create standardized registration protocol

## Blockers

No blockers identified at this time.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Incompatibilities between components | High | Medium | Define strict interfaces and validate compatibility early |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Implement benchmarking and optimize critical paths |
| Registration protocol complexities | High | Medium | Create detailed validation tests and error handling |

## Notes

This sprint consolidates previously planned FastMCP_Sprint and MCP_Integration_Sprint into a comprehensive approach to MCP implementation in Tekton. The goal is to create a robust, standardized MCP foundation across all components.

The architecture decisions have been made to clearly separate responsibilities between:
- Hermes: Internal component communication
- Ergon: External MCP server integration

This separation will allow for cleaner integration with external projects like open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy, and pipedream in future sprints.
