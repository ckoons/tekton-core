## Your Task: Implement FastMCP for Rhetor

### 🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Follow the **exact same methodical step-by-step approach** used successfully for the previous 9 components. Maintain the established **quality standards** and **implementation patterns**.

### 📋 STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

#### Step 1: Investigate Rhetor Structure ✅ **REQUIRED FIRST**
- Examine Rhetor's directory structure and core capabilities
- Read README.md and understand the component's purpose
- Identify existing API structure and entry points
- Confirm Rhetor has backend services that benefit from MCP integration

#### Step 2: Add tekton-core Dependency ✅ **REQUIRED**
- Add `tekton-core>=0.1.0` to Rhetor's requirements.txt or setup.py
- Follow the pattern established in previous components

#### Step 3: Create MCP Module ✅ **REQUIRED**
Create the complete MCP module structure:
```
/Rhetor/rhetor/core/mcp/
├── __init__.py
├── capabilities.py  
└── tools.py
```

**Expected Capabilities (3-4):**
- `llm_management` - Model selection, configuration, and lifecycle
- `prompt_engineering` - Template management and optimization
- `context_management` - Context optimization and budget management  
- `agency_alignment` - Communication and alignment management

**Expected Tools (10-15):**
- LLM model operations (list, select, configure, health check)
- Prompt template operations (create, update, optimize, test)
- Context operations (analyze, optimize, truncate, summarize)
- Agency operations (align, communicate, validate)

#### Step 4: Add FastMCP Endpoints ✅ **REQUIRED**
- Create `rhetor/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py` with comprehensive MCP endpoints
- Integrate into main API app with startup/shutdown handlers
- Add specialized endpoints under `/api/mcp/v2`
- Implement 2-3 predefined workflows for complex operations

#### Step 5: Create Testing & Documentation ✅ **REQUIRED**
- Create `examples/test_fastmcp.py` with comprehensive test coverage
- Create `examples/run_fastmcp_test.sh` executable test runner
- Create detailed `MCP_INTEGRATION.md` documentation
- Test coverage should include all tools, workflows, and error scenarios

#### Step 6: Update Progress Documentation ✅ **REQUIRED**
- Update `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/MCP_Unified_Integration_Sprint/ProgressSummary.md`
- Add Rhetor implementation details following established format
- Update completion percentage to 12/16 (75%)

#### Step 7: Prepare Handoff ✅ **REQUIRED**
- Create handoff document for the next session
- Identify the next component (likely Sophia)
- Document any insights or recommendations

## 🏗️ ESTABLISHED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

### Quality Standards (DO NOT DEVIATE)
- **10-15 FastMCP tools** per component
- **3-4 logical capabilities** with clear organization
- **95%+ test coverage** with real-world scenarios
- **Comprehensive documentation** with extensive examples
- **Consistent API patterns** under `/api/mcp/v2`

### Proven Architecture (FOLLOW EXACTLY)
1. **FastMCP Server Integration**: Startup/shutdown in main API app
2. **Decorator-Based Tools**: Use `@mcp_tool` and `@mcp_capability`
3. **Shared Utilities**: Leverage `tekton.mcp.fastmcp.utils.endpoints`
4. **Workflow Support**: Implement 2-3 complex predefined workflows
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses with clear messages

### Reference Implementations (USE AS TEMPLATES)
- **Latest Best Practices**: `/Prometheus/MCP_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Complex Workflows**: `/Harmonia/prometheus/core/mcp/tools.py`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: `/Metis/examples/test_fastmcp.py`
- **API Integration**: `/Prometheus/prometheus/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py`

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 🎯 METHODICAL APPROACH IS ESSENTIAL
1. **Complete each step fully** before proceeding to the next
2. **Follow the exact patterns** used in previous components
3. **Maintain consistent quality** across all deliverables
4. **Test thoroughly** before marking any step complete

### 🔍 RHETOR-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS
- **LLM Integration**: Deep integration with existing LLM adapter systems
