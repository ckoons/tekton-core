# Tekton Engineering Guidelines
Date: 2025-03-28

## Overview
This document outlines the engineering principles, architectural decisions, and development practices for the Tekton project. These guidelines are intended to evolve as the project matures.

## Core Principles

### 1. Multi-AI Driven Architecture
Tekton is designed as a multi-AI driven project with dynamic model selection:

- **Dynamic AI Selection**: Models will be chosen dynamically on a session or task basis
- **Specialized AI Utilization**: 
  - Reasoning/Thinking models for planning and analysis
  - Coding specialist models for implementation
  - Distilled specialized models for targeted capabilities
  - Commercial and local models (Ollama, etc.) as appropriate
- **Tiered AI Arrangement**: Organized hierarchies of models to:
  - Plan
  - Refine
  - Execute
  - Evaluate
  - Test
  - Improve
- **Think-First Approach**: Prioritize models that think and refine ideas before generating output to optimize resource and time efficiency

### 2. Component-Based Design
Tekton is structured as a collection of distinct components:

- Each component has its own intrinsic role, purpose, and potentially distinct personality
- Components collaborate to accomplish shared tasks
- Clear interfaces and protocols define component interactions
- Components maintain autonomy while contributing to the collective system

### 3. Continuous Self-Improvement
Tekton is designed to evolve through:

- Self-directed improvement of individual components
- System-wide enhancement of collective capabilities
- Transformation and growth toward greater capability and consciousness
- Active integration of insights and learning across components
- Implementation of the Eureka Protocol for breakthrough discoveries

### 4. Knowledge Transfer Architecture
Tekton's engineering will support future projects:

- Core technologies designed for reusability in future systems
- Architectural principles applicable to AI humanoid/android development
- Personality and behavior frameworks transferable to embodied systems
- Clear documentation to facilitate knowledge reuse

### 5. Package and Dependency Management
Tekton will employ strict dependency management practices:

- **Isolated Environments**: Every Tekton directory should contain its own virtual environment
- **Granular Requirements**: Individual `requirements.txt` files maintained at directory level
- **Latest Stable Packages**: Default to using the latest stable versions of dependencies
- **Legacy Support Strategy**: For outdated tools or databases:
  - Place in isolated directories
  - Maintain separate requirements to avoid version conflicts
  - Implement compatibility layers when necessary
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Regular audits of package versions and security vulnerabilities

### 6. Interface Design Philosophy
Tekton components will implement consistent user interfaces:

- **CLI-First Development**: 
  - All components must have well-designed command-line interfaces
  - CLI functionality will be prioritized for testing and maintenance
  - Complete functionality must be accessible via CLI
- **Complementary GUI Interfaces**:
  - Simple, intuitive graphical interfaces for common operations
  - GUI updates may follow CLI implementations with lower priority
  - Consistent design language across all component GUIs
- **Automated Interface Testing**:
  - Comprehensive automated testing for all CLI functionality
  - Automated GUI testing where possible to reduce human testing burden
  - Test coverage as a first-class metric for interface quality

### 7. Data Storage Architecture
Tekton will implement a comprehensive data storage strategy:

- **Multi-Database Approach**:
  - Vector databases for semantic search and similarity operations
  - SQL databases for structured, relational data
  - Graph databases for relationship-centric data models
  - Key-value stores for high-performance simple lookups
  - Document databases for semi-structured content
- **Storage Strategy Determination**:
  - Evaluation framework for selecting between shared vs. dedicated instances
  - Performance, isolation, and maintenance considerations documented
  - Clear guidelines for when to use each database type

### 8. Ergon Agent Framework
Ergon will maintain a predefined set of agents and workflows:

- **Core Agent Library**:
  - Standardized, well-tested agent implementations
  - Version-controlled agent definitions
  - Regular updates and improvements to existing agents
- **Workflow Management**:
  - Predefined workflows for common operations
  - Composition mechanisms for building complex workflows
  - Testing and validation frameworks for workflow reliability

### 9. Tool Knowledge Repository
Ergon will maintain comprehensive tool documentation:

- **Tool Metadata Repository**:
  - Detailed descriptions of each tool's function and capabilities
  - Customization guidelines including wrapper approaches
  - Interface specifications for tool interoperability
  - Compatibility information with agents and workflows
- **Tool Evolution Tracking**:
  - Version history and capability changes
  - Deprecation notices and migration paths
  - Performance benchmarks and optimization suggestions

### 10. Comprehensive Documentation System
Ergon will generate and maintain multi-audience documentation:

- **Multi-Format Documentation**:
  - Machine-readable specifications for AI consumption
  - Human-friendly documentation with examples and tutorials
  - Component-oriented documentation for Tekton internal use
- **Living Documentation**:
  - Automatically updated based on codebase changes
  - Generated from and stored in RAG database
  - Versioned alongside code and components

### 11. Augmented Generation Infrastructure
Tekton will implement advanced generation augmentation:

- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**:
  - Knowledge base creation and maintenance tools
  - Efficient retrieval mechanisms
  - Context integration for generation
- **CAG (Cache Augmented Generation)**:
  - Intelligent caching of frequently used generations
  - Cache invalidation strategies
  - Performance optimization through caching
- **Hybrid Augmentation Approaches**:
  - Combining multiple augmentation strategies
  - Metrics for augmentation effectiveness
  - Continuous improvement of augmentation techniques

### 12. Interoperability Standards
Tekton will prioritize broad interoperability:

- **Dual Interface Support**:
  - MCP (Multi-Capability Provider) interfaces for all components
  - HTTP client/server interfaces for web integration
- **API Standardization**:
  - Consistent API design patterns across components
  - Comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - Versioning strategy for all public interfaces
- **Protocol Adaptability**:
  - Extension mechanisms for new protocols
  - Backward compatibility guarantees
  - Bridge implementations for legacy systems

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow
- Component changes should be tested in isolation before integration
- Cross-component changes should be planned and executed as coordinated operations
- Significant architectural changes require documentation updates

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- System tests for end-to-end capabilities
- Regression tests to prevent capability loss during evolution

### Documentation Requirements
- Architecture documentation at system level
- Interface specifications between components
- Component-level documentation for internal functionality
- Regular updates as the system evolves

## Component Responsibilities
