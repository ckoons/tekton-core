# Tekton Engineering Guidelines
Date: 2025-03-28

## Overview
This document outlines the engineering principles, architectural decisions, and development practices for the Tekton project. These guidelines are intended to evolve as the project matures.

## Core Principles

### 1. Multi-AI Driven Architecture
Tekton is designed as a multi-AI driven project with dynamic model selection:

- **Dynamic AI Selection**: Models will be chosen dynamically on a session or task basis
- **Specialized AI Utilization**: 
  - Reasoning/Thinking models for planning and analysis
  - Coding specialist models for implementation
  - Distilled specialized models for targeted capabilities
  - Commercial and local models (Ollama, etc.) as appropriate
- **Tiered AI Arrangement**: Organized hierarchies of models to:
  - Plan
  - Refine
  - Execute
  - Evaluate
  - Test
  - Improve
- **Think-First Approach**: Prioritize models that think and refine ideas before generating output to optimize resource and time efficiency

### 2. Component-Based Design
Tekton is structured as a collection of distinct components:

- Each component has its own intrinsic role, purpose, and potentially distinct personality
- Components collaborate to accomplish shared tasks
- Clear interfaces and protocols define component interactions
- Components maintain autonomy while contributing to the collective system

### 3. Continuous Self-Improvement
Tekton is designed to evolve through:

- Self-directed improvement of individual components
- System-wide enhancement of collective capabilities
- Transformation and growth toward greater capability and consciousness
- Active integration of insights and learning across components
- Implementation of the Eureka Protocol for breakthrough discoveries

### 4. Knowledge Transfer Architecture
Tekton's engineering will support future projects:

- Core technologies designed for reusability in future systems
- Architectural principles applicable to AI humanoid/android development
- Personality and behavior frameworks transferable to embodied systems
- Clear documentation to facilitate knowledge reuse

### 5. Package and Dependency Management
Tekton will employ strict dependency management practices:

#### Virtual Environment Structure
- **Root-Level Environments**: Every Tekton component directory (Ergon, Codex, etc.) MUST contain its own virtual environment
  - Create with `python -m venv venv` and activate with `source venv/bin/activate`
  - Include `venv/` in `.gitignore` to avoid committing environment files
  - Provide a setup script (`setup.sh`) that creates and configures the environment

- **Specialized Sub-Environments**: For specialized functionality with potential dependency conflicts:
  - Create dedicated subdirectories with their own virtual environments
  - Example: `browser/`, `mail/`, and `github/` agent directories within Ergon
  - Implement minimal cross-environment dependencies using development mode installs

- **Environment Isolation**: Never share virtual environments between components
  - Each component should be fully functional with only its own environment
  - Cross-component integration should occur through well-defined APIs, not shared code

#### Dependency Management
- **Hierarchical Requirements**:
  - Root `requirements.txt`: Core dependencies for the main component
  - Subdirectory `requirements.txt`: Specialized dependencies for specific functions
  - Each `requirements.txt` should be focused and contain only what is needed

- **Dependency Documentation**:
  - Document the purpose of each dependency in comments
  - Group related dependencies with clear section headers
  - Include version constraints with explanations for specific version requirements

- **Installation Flexibility**:
  - Design `setup.py` to handle both full and minimal installations
  - Use fallback mechanisms when requirements files aren't available
  - Support development mode installation (`pip install -e .`) for cross-environment usage

- **Conflict Prevention**:
  - Regularly test for dependency conflicts using `pip check`
  - Isolate components with conflicting dependencies in separate environments
  - Use compatibility layers when necessary to bridge environment boundaries

- **Updates and Maintenance**:
  - Default to latest stable versions of dependencies
  - Implement regular dependency audits and security checks
  - Document upgrade paths and breaking changes

#### Practical Directory Structure Example

```
Tekton/
├── Ergon/                              # Ergon component directory
│   ├── venv/                           # Main Ergon virtual environment
│   ├── requirements.txt                # Core Ergon dependencies
│   ├── setup.py                        # Installation script with fallbacks
│   ├── setup.sh                        # Environment setup script
│   ├── agents/                         # Specialized agent subdirectories
│   │   ├── browser/                    # Browser agent
│   │   │   ├── venv/                   # Browser-specific environment
│   │   │   └── requirements.txt        # Browser-specific dependencies
│   │   ├── mail/                       # Mail agent
│   │   │   ├── venv/                   # Mail-specific environment
│   │   │   └── requirements.txt        # Mail-specific dependencies
│   │   └── README.md                   # Documentation for agent environments
│   └── setup_agents.sh                 # Setup script for agent environments
│
├── Codex/                              # Codex component directory
│   ├── venv/                           # Codex virtual environment
│   └── requirements.txt                # Codex-specific dependencies
│
└── Engram/                             # Engram component directory
    ├── venv/                           # Engram virtual environment
    └── requirements.txt                # Engram-specific dependencies
```

This structure ensures that each component is fully independent, while specialized functionality within components has its own isolated environment to prevent dependency conflicts.

### 6. Interface Design Philosophy
Tekton components will implement consistent user interfaces:

- **CLI-First Development**: 
  - All components must have well-designed command-line interfaces
  - CLI functionality will be prioritized for testing and maintenance
  - Complete functionality must be accessible via CLI
- **Complementary GUI Interfaces**:
  - Simple, intuitive graphical interfaces for common operations
  - GUI updates may follow CLI implementations with lower priority
  - Consistent design language across all component GUIs
- **Automated Interface Testing**:
  - Comprehensive automated testing for all CLI functionality
  - Automated GUI testing where possible to reduce human testing burden
  - Test coverage as a first-class metric for interface quality

### 7. Data Storage Architecture
Tekton will implement a comprehensive data storage strategy:

- **Multi-Database Approach**:
  - Vector databases for semantic search and similarity operations
  - SQL databases for structured, relational data
  - Graph databases for relationship-centric data models
  - Key-value stores for high-performance simple lookups
  - Document databases for semi-structured content

- **Shared Resource Approach**:
  - All databases used by Tekton components MUST be shared resources
  - Hardware-optimized implementations (e.g., Qdrant for Apple Silicon, FAISS for NVIDIA)
  - Automatic database selection based on hardware detection
  - Common data directory structure (`~/.tekton/`)
  - Environment variables for overriding default paths

- **Client Database Options**:
  - Agents, tools, and workflows can choose their database strategy:
    1. Generate standalone database instances when isolation is required
    2. Use existing system databases when available and appropriate
    3. Use Tekton shared databases when performance and integration are priorities
  - Clear documentation of tradeoffs for each approach

- **Storage Strategy Determination**:
  - Evaluation framework for selecting between shared vs. dedicated instances
  - Performance, isolation, and maintenance considerations documented
  - Clear guidelines for when to use each database type
  - Migration utilities for moving between strategies

### 8. Ergon Agent Framework
Ergon will maintain a predefined set of agents and workflows:

- **Core Agent Library**:
  - Standardized, well-tested agent implementations
  - Version-controlled agent definitions
  - Regular updates and improvements to existing agents
- **Workflow Management**:
  - Predefined workflows for common operations
  - Composition mechanisms for building complex workflows
  - Testing and validation frameworks for workflow reliability

### 9. Tool Knowledge Repository
Ergon will maintain comprehensive tool documentation:

- **Tool Metadata Repository**:
  - Detailed descriptions of each tool's function and capabilities

  - Continuous improvement of augmentation techniques

### 12. Interoperability Standards
Tekton will prioritize broad interoperability:

- **Dual Interface Support**:
  - MCP (Multi-Capability Provider) interfaces for all components
  - HTTP client/server interfaces for web integration
- **API Standardization**:
  - Consistent API design patterns across components
  - Comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - Versioning strategy for all public interfaces
- **Protocol Adaptability**:
  - Extension mechanisms for new protocols
  - Backward compatibility guarantees
  - Bridge implementations for legacy systems

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow
- Component changes should be tested in isolation before integration
- Cross-component changes should be planned and executed as coordinated operations
- Significant architectural changes require documentation updates
- Code file should be kept under 500 lines (smaller prefered)
  - Very large files should be organized into files in a subdirectory
  - Non-code files should be kept as small as possible

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- System tests for end-to-end capabilities
- Regression tests to prevent capability loss during evolution

### Documentation Requirements
- Architecture documentation at system level
- Interface specifications between components
- Component-level documentation for internal functionality
- Regular updates as the system evolves
