| Synthesis | 5005 | ✅ Running | Execution engine for implementing plans |
| Hephaestus | 8080, 8081 | ✅ Running | UI system for interaction |
| Rhetor | N/A | ✅ Initialized | Communication systems |
| Athena | N/A | ✅ Initialized | Knowledge graph component |
| Telos | N/A | ✅ Initialized | User interface component |
| Prometheus | N/A | ✅ Initialized | Planning system |
| Harmonia | N/A | ✅ Initialized | Workflow orchestration |
| Sophia | N/A | ✅ Initialized | Machine learning component |

## Recent Fixes (April 2025)

### 1. Synthesis Execution Engine

**Issues Fixed:**
- Fixed asyncio event loop handling in Synthesis server script
- Resolved issues with nested event loops causing startup failures
- Fixed server script overwriting during launch process

**Approach:**
- Restructured event loop handling to avoid asyncio.run() conflicts
- Implemented persistent script management to preserve custom changes
- Added proper error handling and process management
- Improved FastAPI and Uvicorn integration

**Result:**
- Synthesis server now runs successfully on port 5005
- API endpoint responds to health checks
- Component properly registers with Hermes
- Successfully integrated into the launch system

### 2. Launch Script Enhancements

**Improvements:**
- Added conditional script file generation to avoid overwriting customizations
- Enhanced dependency ordering to ensure components start in the correct sequence
- Added more verbose status reporting during launch process
- Implemented better error handling for component-specific issues

### 3. Component Integration

**Improvements:**
- Successfully integrated all core components (Hermes, Engram, Ergon, Synthesis, Hephaestus)
- Added support for additional components like Rhetor, Athena, Prometheus, etc.
- Enhanced port checking and management across components
- Fixed registration flow with the Hermes service registry

## Component Details

### 1. Engram Memory System

**Current Status:**
- Server successfully starts on port 8000
- Health endpoint responds correctly
- Using fallback mode to avoid vector database dependencies
- Core memory functionality available

### 2. Hermes Service Registry

**Current Status:**
- API server running on port 8100
- Database service running on port 8101
- Component registration functionality working
- Health checks successfully respond

### 3. Ergon Agent System

**Current Status:**
- Server running on port 8200
- Successfully integrated with Hermes
- Agent management functionality available

### 4. Synthesis Execution Engine

**Current Status:**
- Server running on port 5005
- Execution engine properly initialized
- FastAPI endpoints responding to requests
- Successfully handling async operations

### 5. Hephaestus UI

**Current Status:**
- HTTP server running on port 8080
- WebSocket server running on port 8081
- UI components load correctly
- Access available via web browser

## Launch Process

The Tekton launch system follows this process:

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Port availability is checked
   - Previous processes are terminated if needed
   - Log and data directories are created

2. **Component Dependency Order**
   - Core infrastructure first (Hermes, Engram)
   - Mid-level components next (Ergon, Rhetor, Harmonia)
   - Specialized components (Athena, Prometheus, Sophia, Telos)
   - UI system last (Hephaestus)

3. **Per-Component Launch**
   - Component-specific initialization
   - Health verification
   - Port validation
   - Registration with Hermes (where applicable)

## Usage Instructions

### Full System Launch

To launch all components:

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton
./scripts/tekton_launch --components hermes,engram,rhetor,ergon,athena,telos,sophia,harmonia,prometheus,synthesis,hephaestus --non-interactive
```

### Component Selection

For interactive component selection:

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton
./scripts/tekton_launch --interactive
```

### Checking Component Status

To verify running components:

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton
./scripts/tekton_status
```

### Shutting Down Components

To stop all components cleanly:

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton
./scripts/tekton_kill
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Component Health Monitoring**
   - Add systematic health checks across all components
   - Implement automatic restart capability for failed components

2. **Enhanced Component Registration**
   - Standardize registration process with Hermes
   - Add consistent endpoint formats and capability declarations

3. **Dynamic Port Management**
   - Implement configuration-driven port assignment
   - Add support for port ranges and automatic assignment

4. **Component Lifecycle Management**
   - Add versioning support for component compatibility checking
   - Implement graceful upgrade paths for components

5. **UI Integration**
   - Integrate component status monitoring in Hephaestus UI
   - Add component management capabilities through the UI

6. **Security Enhancements**
   - Add authentication for component APIs
   - Implement secure communication between components
   - Add user authentication for UI access
