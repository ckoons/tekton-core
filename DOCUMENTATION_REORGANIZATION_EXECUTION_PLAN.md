# Documentation Reorganization Execution Plan

This execution plan outlines the systematic approach for reorganizing Tekton's documentation. It provides a step-by-step process to ensure a thorough and effective transition.

## Phase 1: Discovery and Analysis

1. **Inventory Existing Documentation**
   - List all .md files in the repository
   - Group by component and topic
   - Create a document inventory spreadsheet
   
2. **Document Assessment**
   - Evaluate each document for:
     - Relevance
     - Currency
     - Quality
     - Content value
   - Tag each document as:
     - Keep (migrate as-is)
     - Refactor (extract valuable content)
     - Archive (historical value)
     - Delete (outdated/redundant)

3. **Content Mapping**
   - Map existing content to the new structure
   - Identify content gaps
   - Identify content overlaps and redundancies
   - Create a content migration plan

## Phase 2: Structure Implementation

1. **Create Directory Structure**
   - Set up the MetaData directory
   - Create ComponentDocumentation directories
   - Set up TektonDocumentation structure
   - Create necessary subdirectories

2. **Create Document Templates**
   - Create templates for:
     - Component README.md
     - Component documentation files
     - Project-level documentation
     - Development sprint documentation
   - Establish standardized headers, sections, and formats

3. **Set Up Cross-Reference System**
   - Define link format and standards
   - Create placeholder links for new documents
   - Design documentation index

## Phase 3: Content Migration

1. **Component Documentation**
   - Update component README.md files
   - Create standardized component documentation
   - Migrate content from existing files
   - Create new content to fill gaps

2. **Project-Level Documentation**
   - Create TektonOverview document
   - Develop architecture documentation
   - Create development guidelines
   - Set up user guides

3. **Development Sprint Documentation**
   - Organize sprint documentation by branch/topic
   - Standardize format
   - Migrate existing content

4. **Archive Historical Documents**
   - Create OriginalDocuments structure
   - Move legacy documents to archive
   - Add context and relevance notes

## Phase 4: Cleanup and Validation

1. **Remove Outdated Documents**
   - Delete irrelevant files
   - Remove redundant content
   - Clean up temporary files

2. **Validate Documentation**
   - Check all links
   - Verify content accuracy
   - Ensure consistent formatting
   - Test navigation paths

3. **Create Documentation Index**
   - Develop master index
   - Add cross-component references
   - Create topic-based indices

## Phase 5: Final Review and Reporting

1. **Documentation Quality Check**
   - Review all new and migrated documents
   - Check for consistency in style and format
   - Verify compliance with standards

2. **Comprehensive Report**
   - Summarize changes made
   - List files created, archived, and deleted
   - Identify remaining content gaps
   - Provide recommendations for future maintenance

3. **Transition Plan**
   - Document the new structure
   - Create guidelines for maintaining documentation
   - Recommend automation for documentation management

## Execution Strategy

The reorganization will follow these strategic approaches:

1. **Component-by-Component Approach**
   - Start with one component's documentation
   - Complete the full process for that component
   - Use it as a template for other components
   - Recommended starting components: Hermes or Engram (core components)

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Create directory structure for all components simultaneously
   - Work on independent components in parallel
   - Consolidate cross-component documentation at the end

3. **Top-Down Approach**
   - Begin with high-level project documentation
   - Move to component-level documentation
   - Finish with detailed implementation documentation

4. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Create basic structure and templates first
   - Conduct initial content migration
   - Refine organization and cross-references
   - Finalize formatting and consistency

## Risk Management

1. **Content Loss**
   - Always archive before deleting
   - Use temporary staging areas for content migration
   - Conduct regular backups during the process

2. **Inconsistency**
   - Establish clear templates and rules
   - Conduct regular consistency reviews
   - Use automated tools to check formatting

3. **Incomplete Migration**
   - Track migration progress with checklists
   - Prioritize critical documentation
   - Identify acceptable gaps for future work

4. **Link Breakage**
   - Validate all links after migration
   - Use consistent link patterns
   - Create redirects for important documents

## Progress Tracking

The reorganization progress will be tracked against these milestones:

1. Directory structure created (100%)
2. Templates established (100%)
3. Content mapped to new structure (100%)
4. Component documentation migrated (% by component)
5. Project documentation migrated (% by section)
6. Historical documents archived (%)
7. Outdated documents removed (%)
8. Links validated (%)
9. Documentation index created (%)
10. Final review completed (%)

This execution plan provides a systematic approach to the documentation reorganization, ensuring thoroughness, consistency, and preservation of valuable content.
