# A2A and MCP Implementation Prompt for Claude Code

I'd like you to implement the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Framework and Multimodal Cognitive Protocol (MCP) for the Tekton ecosystem. These technologies will enable autonomous agent collaboration and enhanced multimodal information processing throughout our AI orchestration system.

## Project Background

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. We've already implemented several core components including Hermes (message bus), Ergon (agent framework), Engram (memory system), Rhetor (LLM interaction), Athena (knowledge graph), Synthesis (execution engine), and Sophia (continuous improvement).

The next evolutionary step is implementing A2A and MCP, which will enable these components to communicate more effectively, collaborate autonomously, and process multimodal information seamlessly.

## Implementation Overview

Your task is to implement:

1. **A2A Communication Framework**: Enabling autonomous agent collaboration through standardized messaging
2. **Multimodal Cognitive Protocol (MCP)**: Providing multimodal information processing capabilities

Key capabilities to implement include:

- Agent discovery and registration
- Task delegation and tracking
- Multi-message conversations
- Multimodal message processing (text, code, images, structured data)
- Enhanced context management
- Tool registration and execution

## Detailed Documentation

I've prepared comprehensive documentation to guide your implementation:

1. **A2A_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide with code examples and implementation details
2. **A2A_MCP_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed architecture diagrams and component relationships
3. **A2A_MCP_TASK_PROMPT.md**: Specific implementation tasks and deliverables

Please carefully review these documents before starting implementation, as they contain critical details about the architecture, data formats, and integration points.

## Implementation Requirements

The implementation should follow these guidelines:

1. **Follow Tekton Patterns**: 
   - Use Single Port Architecture for HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
   - Implement proper error handling using tekton_errors
   - Leverage shared utilities from tekton-core
   - Use async/await throughout for non-blocking operations

2. **Protocol Compliance**:
   - Implement strict validation for A2A and MCP message formats
   - Follow the schemas defined in the implementation guide
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing components

3. **Component Integration**:
   - Enhance Hermes with A2A messaging capabilities
   - Extend Ergon with MCP client functionality
   - Create adapters for existing components

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Include comprehensive type annotations
   - Add detailed docstrings for all public APIs
   - Create thorough unit and integration tests

## Key Components to Implement

1. **A2A Protocol Layer**:
   - Agent registry for registration and discovery
   - Message router for agent communication
   - Task manager for delegation and tracking
   - Conversation manager for multi-message exchanges

2. **MCP Protocol Layer**:
   - Message processor for parsing and validation
   - Modality handlers for different content types
   - Context manager for rich contextual information
   - Content integrator for cross-modal analysis

3. **Integration Components**:
   - Hermes A2A service for message routing
   - Ergon MCP client for agent-tool communication
   - Tool registry for capability advertisement
   - External gateway for non-Tekton agents

## Implementation Approach

I recommend this phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Implement core protocol definitions and message handling
2. **Phase 2**: Create agent registry and task management
3. **Phase 3**: Build multimodal processing pipeline
4. **Phase 4**: Integrate with existing Tekton components

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be successful when:

1. Agents can discover each other and communicate autonomously
2. Tasks can be delegated and tracked across agents
3. Components can process multimodal information consistently
4. Existing Tekton components work seamlessly with the new protocols
5. Tests demonstrate robust functionality and performance

Please proceed with implementing these components according to the provided documentation. Feel free to ask clarifying questions about the architecture or requirements if needed.

Thank you for your assistance with this critical enhancement to the Tekton ecosystem!
