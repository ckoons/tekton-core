2. **Launch Pattern** - Standardized to `python -m componentname`
   - Launch scripts use this pattern
   - Documentation explains why it's required
   - Common mistakes warn about missing __main__.py

3. **Enhanced Launcher Compatibility**
   - All components built with this documentation will work with enhanced launcher
   - Testing checklist includes launcher verification

### ✅ All Feedback Implemented
