# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the architectural documentation for the Tekton system. These documents describe the high-level design patterns, component interactions, and system organization that form the foundation of the Tekton platform.

## Core Architectural Documents

### Component Architecture

- [Component Integration Patterns](./ComponentIntegrationPatterns.md): Standardized patterns for integrating components into Tekton
- [Component Isolation Architecture](./ComponentIsolationArchitecture.md): Shadow DOM-based isolation for UI components

### Communication Architecture

- [UI Component Communication](./UIComponentCommunication.md): Communication mechanisms between UI components

### AI and Intelligence Architecture

- [AI Orchestration Architecture](./AI_Orchestration_Architecture.md): AI specialist management and MCP tools orchestration (Phase 3/4)

### State Management

- [State Management Architecture](./StateManagementArchitecture.md): Application-wide state management approach

### To Be Created

- System Architecture Overview
- API Design Principles
- Security Architecture
- Deployment Architecture
- Performance Architecture

## Diagram Conventions

Architectural diagrams in these documents follow these conventions:

1. **Component Diagrams**: UML component diagram notation
2. **Sequence Diagrams**: UML sequence diagram notation
3. **Data Flow Diagrams**: Standard DFD notation with data stores, processes, and flows

## Using These Documents

These architectural documents should be used to:

1. **Understand the System**: Gain a high-level understanding of how Tekton works
2. **Guide Implementation**: Ensure new code follows established patterns
3. **Make Design Decisions**: Evaluate changes against architectural principles
4. **Onboard New Developers**: Help new team members understand the system

## Document Maintenance

When updating architectural documentation:

1. Ensure changes reflect current implementation or planned direction
2. Update all affected diagrams and code examples
3. Maintain backward references to previous approaches when describing changes
4. Include rationale for architectural decisions
