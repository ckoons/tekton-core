# Import Test Results for Shared Requirements

## Summary
Most packages (49/53) are already installed and import successfully. Only 4 packages are not currently installed in the environment:

### Not Currently Installed (Expected)
These packages will be installed when components that need them use the shared requirements:

1. **spacy** (from data.txt) - NLP library, only needed by data science components
2. **python-decouple** (from utilities.txt) - Advanced config management
3. **croniter** (from utilities.txt) - Cron expression parsing
4. **asyncio-throttle** (from utilities.txt) - Rate limiting

### Successfully Tested âœ…
- All packages in **base.txt** (3/3)
- All packages in **web.txt** (11/11) - Fixed PyYAML capitalization
- All packages in **ai.txt** (9/9)
- All packages in **vector.txt** (9/9)
- All packages in **database.txt** (2/2)
- Most packages in **data.txt** (8/9)
- Most packages in **utilities.txt** (8/12)

## Fix Applied
- Changed `pyyaml` to `PyYAML` in web.txt (correct package name)

## Ready for Testing
The shared requirements structure is ready. The 4 missing packages are specialized utilities that aren't needed for core functionality and will be installed by components that actually use them.

You can safely run `tekton-launch --launch-all` to test the stack.
