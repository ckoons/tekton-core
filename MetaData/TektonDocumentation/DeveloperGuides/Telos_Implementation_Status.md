# Telos Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** April 26, 2025

## Current Status

Phase 11 (Telos Requirements Management) completed. Implemented a comprehensive requirements management system following Tekton's Single Port Architecture pattern. The system enables documenting, organizing, tracking, and validating project requirements with support for hierarchical visualization and bidirectional tracing. Key features include a FastAPI backend with HTTP, WebSocket, and event interfaces; requirement quality assessment with LLM integration through Rhetor; interactive requirement refinement; Prometheus integration for planning capabilities; and a shadow DOM UI component for seamless integration with Hephaestus. The implementation provides a solid foundation for requirements engineering within the Tekton ecosystem, enabling teams to capture, refine, and validate requirements before moving into planning and implementation phases.

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created requirements manager core with project and requirement models
- ✅ Implemented hierarchical requirements with parent-child relationships
- ✅ Added bidirectional tracing between related requirements
- ✅ Created requirement validation engine for quality assessment
- ✅ Implemented FastAPI application with Single Port Architecture
- ✅ Created RESTful endpoints for requirements management
- ✅ Implemented WebSocket support for real-time updates
- ✅ Added Prometheus integration for planning capabilities
- ✅ Created interactive requirement refinement with LLM assistance
- ✅ Implemented CLI interface for requirements management
- ✅ Created shadow DOM UI component for Hephaestus integration
- ✅ Added visualization capabilities for requirement relationships
- ✅ Implemented requirement export/import functionality
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for API and usage
- ✅ Implemented test suite for core functionality

## Key Implementations

### Core Domain Model

- **Project**: Container for requirements with metadata
- **Requirement**: Individual requirement with comprehensive attributes
- **Trace**: Bidirectional relationship between requirements
- **Validation**: Quality assessment for requirements

### API Implementation

- **Single Port Architecture**: All communication through port 8008
- **RESTful API**: Projects, requirements, traces, validation, planning
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates for collaborative editing
- **Events Interface**: Server-sent events for notifications

### Integration Points

- **Hermes**: Service registration and discovery
- **Prometheus**: Planning and task breakdown
- **Rhetor**: LLM-powered requirement analysis
- **Hephaestus**: Shadow DOM UI component

### LLM Integration

- **Direct LLM Access**: Using Rhetor's LLM client
- **Client Fallback**: Rhetor client as secondary option
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: Guaranteed analysis even without LLM

### CLI Functionality

- **Project Management**: Create, list, show, delete
- **Requirement Management**: Add, list, show, update, delete
- **Visualization**: Generate hierarchy and trace diagrams
- **Interactive Refinement**: Guided requirement improvement
