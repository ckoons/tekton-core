- Multiple AI providers via External AI Integration

## Implementation Approach

For each component, follow this sequence:

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Define component interfaces and API
   - Create data models and schemas
   - Design UI wireframes
   - Establish integration points

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Develop backend functionality
   - Create service layer with State Management
   - Implement UI with BEM naming conventions
   - Build integration connectors

3. **Testing Phase**:
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality
   - Add integration tests for component connections
   - Test UI with different scenarios
   - Validate performance requirements

4. **Documentation Phase**:
   - Update component documentation
   - Create API reference
   - Add examples and usage patterns
   - Document integration options

5. **Integration Phase**:
   - Connect with Tekton Dashboard
   - Register with Hermes
   - Implement hooks for other components
   - Validate end-to-end workflows

## Standards and Best Practices

Ensure all implementations follow these established standards:

1. **Code Organization**:
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Modular architecture
   - Consistent file structure
   - Comprehensive commenting

2. **UI Implementation**:
   - Direct HTML insertion with proper DOM cleanup
   - BEM naming convention for CSS
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG)

3. **State Management**:
   - Centralized state in service layer
   - Event-based updates via subscriptions
   - Clear state namespaces
   - Persistent state for preferences

4. **Integration**:
   - Standard service registration
   - Consistent event naming
   - Clear API documentation
   - Versioned interfaces

5. **Performance**:
   - Efficient data structures
   - Optimized API calls
   - Lazy loading where appropriate
   - Caching for frequently accessed data

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive guide for the remaining Tekton components. By following the established patterns and best practices, each component will integrate seamlessly with the existing system, creating a cohesive, intelligent orchestration platform for AI-assisted software development.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with each component building upon the foundations established by previous phases. The end result will be a complete Tekton system that fulfills all the goals and vision outlined in the roadmap.
