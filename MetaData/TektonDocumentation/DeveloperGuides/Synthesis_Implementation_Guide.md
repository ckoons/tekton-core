# Synthesis Implementation Guide

**Last Updated:** May 22, 2025

## Overview

This guide outlines the implementation plan for the Synthesis execution engine component in the Tekton ecosystem. Synthesis is responsible for executing processes, integrating with external systems, and orchestrating workflows across various Tekton components.

## Current Status

The Synthesis component currently has foundational code including:

- Basic execution models (`execution_models.py`)
- Core execution engine scaffold (`execution_engine.py`)
- Phase models for execution phases (`phase_models.py`)
- Condition evaluation logic (`condition_evaluator.py`)
- Integration base classes (`integration_base.py`)
- Component adapters (`integration_adapters.py`)
- Execution step handlers (`execution_step.py`)

These files provide a foundation but require comprehensive implementation to meet the requirements for Synthesis as a fully functional execution and integration engine.

## Potential Shared Utilities

During implementation, identify patterns that could be extracted as shared utilities:

1. **Process Engine Abstractions**: Common process execution patterns could become a shared utility
2. **Integration Framework**: The integration adapter system could be reused by other components
3. **Event System**: The event generation and subscription system could be standardized
4. **Execution Visualization**: The execution visualization tools could be extracted for reuse
