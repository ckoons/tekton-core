## Files Pending Migration

All planned documentation files have been migrated or archived. If additional needs are identified during implementation, they will be added to this log.

## Notes on Migration Process

1. **Archive Directory Structure**:
   - All archived files maintain their original names with ARCHIVED_ prefix
   - Each file includes a header indicating its archived status
   - Files are categorized by original location

2. **Documentation Standards**:
   - All new documentation follows Markdown best practices
   - Documentation includes examples and code snippets
   - Clear section structure with descriptive headings
   - Links to related documentation

3. **Review Process**:
   - All new documentation has been reviewed for technical accuracy
   - Documentation has been tested with example implementations
   - Cross-references have been validated

## Reference Header for Archived Files

The following header is added to all archived files:

```markdown
# [ARCHIVED] - This document is no longer current

> **NOTICE:** This documentation has been archived on [DATE] as part of the Hephaestus UI simplification.
