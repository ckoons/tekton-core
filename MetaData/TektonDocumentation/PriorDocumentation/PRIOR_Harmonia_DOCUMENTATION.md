# Harmonia Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for Harmonia, the workflow orchestration engine for the Tekton ecosystem. This document serves as an index to the various documentation files that provide detailed information about different aspects of Harmonia.

## Overview

Harmonia is a powerful workflow orchestration component that coordinates complex tasks across the Tekton ecosystem, manages state persistence, and handles task sequencing. Named after the Greek goddess of harmony and concord, Harmonia brings together various Tekton components to work in unison.

## Concepts and Features

### Core Concepts

- **Workflows**: Definitions of process flows and task sequences
- **Tasks**: Individual units of work within a workflow
- **Executions**: Instances of workflows being executed
- **State Management**: Persisting and managing workflow state
- **Events**: Real-time notifications of workflow and task status changes

### Key Features

- **Workflow Definition and Execution**: Create and run complex workflows with dependencies
- **Cross-Component Task Orchestration**: Coordinate tasks across various Tekton components
- **State Management and Persistence**: Save and resume workflow state, create checkpoints
- **Template System**: Create reusable workflow templates with parameter substitution
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Robust retry mechanisms and failure recovery
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Subscribe to workflow events via WebSockets and SSE
- **Checkpoint/Resume Capability**: Create snapshots of workflow state and resume from them
- **Single Port Architecture**: All APIs accessible through a unified port following Tekton standards
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor workflow execution with real-time updates
- **Cross-Component Integration**: Seamless integration with other Tekton components

## Integration with Tekton

Harmonia integrates with other Tekton components:

- **Hermes**: Service discovery and registration
- **Engram**: Long-term memory and state persistence
- **Rhetor**: LLM interactions for workflow decisions
- **Prometheus**: Metrics and monitoring
- **Synthesis**: Task execution and integration
- **Ergon**: Command execution and automation

## API and Interfaces

- **HTTP REST API**: For workflow management and execution
- **WebSocket API**: For real-time events and monitoring
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For event streaming
- **Python Client**: Programmatic interface for Python applications
- **JavaScript Client**: Client for web applications

## Development and Deployment

- **Installation**: Various methods to install Harmonia
- **Configuration**: Configuration options and environment variables
- **Running**: Running Harmonia standalone or with Tekton
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
- **Development Setup**: Setting up a development environment
