# Claude Code Task for Synthesis Implementation

I need you to implement Synthesis, Tekton's execution and integration engine component. Synthesis is responsible for executing processes, integrating with external systems (CLI, API, MCP), and orchestrating workflows across the Tekton ecosystem.

Start by reviewing the following resources to understand Synthesis's purpose, requirements, and implementation plan:

1. Review the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md file in the Synthesis directory to understand the component's requirements and implementation plan.
2. Examine the DELIVERABLES.md file to understand the specific deliverables expected for this implementation.
3. Read the PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md file to understand the recommended project structure and implementation sequence.
4. Examine existing code in the Synthesis directory, particularly:
   - synthesis/core/execution_models.py
   - synthesis/core/execution_engine.py
   - synthesis/core/integration_base.py
   - synthesis/core/integration_adapters.py
   - synthesis/core/condition_evaluator.py
   - synthesis/core/execution_step.py
5. Understand the Single Port Architecture pattern from docs/SINGLE_PORT_ARCHITECTURE.md
6. Examine the shared utilities in tekton-core/tekton/utils/ to leverage them in the implementation.

Your task is to implement Synthesis following the Tekton engineering guidelines, with specific focus on:

1. **Core Execution Engine**:
   - Enhance execution models with additional metadata and statistics
   - Implement variable management and substitution
   - Complete the execution engine with parallel execution support
   - Implement step dependency resolution
   - Add execution control (pause, resume, cancel)
   - Create comprehensive step type handlers
   - Implement conditional execution and looping

2. **Integration System**:
   - Complete the component adapter architecture
   - Implement CLI integration for command execution
   - Create API integration for external services
   - Add MCP integration for machine control
   - Implement authentication and security
   - Create capability discovery and mapping
   - Add error handling and retry mechanisms

3. **Process Management**:
   - Implement process definition models
   - Create execution persistence and history
   - Add checkpoint and resume capabilities
   - Implement error recovery strategies
   - Create execution metrics collection
   - Add input/output mapping between steps
   - Implement environment variable support

4. **Event System**:
   - Create event models and generation
   - Implement event subscription
   - Add event correlation
   - Create event persistence
   - Implement event routing

5. **API Implementation**:
   - Implement FastAPI endpoints following Single Port Architecture
   - Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - Create OpenAPI documentation
   - Implement authentication and authorization
   - Add input validation and error handling
   - Create rate limiting and request throttling

6. **Component Integration**:
   - Complete Hermes registration
   - Implement Prometheus integration for planning
   - Add Athena integration for knowledge
   - Create Engram integration for memory
   - Implement Rhetor integration for LLM capabilities
   - Add other component integrations as needed

7. **UI Component**:
   - Create process execution visualization
   - Implement execution control interface
   - Add execution history display
   - Create integration configuration UI
   - Implement real-time execution monitoring

**Required Deliverables**:

1. Complete implementation of the core execution engine with support for all execution patterns.
2. Fully functional integration system with adapters for CLI, API, and MCP.
3. Process management system with persistence, history, and control.
4. Event system for execution monitoring and notification.
5. API layer with REST endpoints and WebSocket support.
6. Integration with other Tekton components.
7. UI component for Hephaestus.
8. Comprehensive test suite for all components.
9. Complete documentation.

**Technical Requirements**:

1. Use the shared utilities from tekton-core to ensure consistency with other components.
2. Follow the Single Port Architecture pattern.
3. Implement proper error handling using standardized error types.
4. Use async/await for all I/O operations.
5. Implement comprehensive logging.
6. Add type hints to all functions.
7. Include docstrings for all classes and functions.
8. Follow the Tekton engineering guidelines for code style and conventions.
9. Register with Hermes for component discovery.
10. Integrate with the Hephaestus UI framework for the UI component.

**Implementation Notes**:

1. Focus on creating a robust execution engine first, as it's the core of Synthesis.
2. The integration system must be flexible enough to handle various external systems.
3. Pay special attention to error handling and recovery mechanisms.
4. Use test-driven development where appropriate.
5. Consider performance optimization for the execution engine.
6. Ensure proper state management for execution persistence.
7. Make security a priority for all integration points.
8. Implement comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities.

Several areas need special attention during implementation:

1. **Integration Flexibility**: The integration system must support diverse external systems with different protocols while maintaining a unified interface.

2. **Execution State Management**: Tracking execution state reliably across steps, pauses, and failures requires careful design.

3. **Step Dependency Resolution**: Complex workflows with conditions and parallel execution need sophisticated dependency handling.

4. **Variable Substitution**: Implement a robust expression evaluation system for dynamic substitution and conditions.

5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate recovery strategies is critical.

6. **Performance**: The execution engine must be efficient with minimal overhead, especially for complex workflows.

After completing the implementation, please:

1. Update the Tekton roadmap to reflect the completion of Synthesis.
2. Document any patterns you identified that could become shared utilities.
3. Create a brief summary of the implementation and any challenges faced.

Your implementation should be production-ready, well-tested, and fully documented.
