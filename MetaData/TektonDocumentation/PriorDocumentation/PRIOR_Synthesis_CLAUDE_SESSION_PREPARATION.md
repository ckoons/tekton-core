## Implementation Focus

The implementation focuses on six key areas:

1. **Core Execution Engine**: Enhanced execution models, step dependency resolution, variable management
2. **Integration System**: CLI, API, and MCP integration with standardized adapter pattern
3. **Process Management**: Process definition, execution, monitoring, and control
4. **Event System**: Event generation, subscription, and correlation
5. **API Layer**: RESTful API and WebSocket implementation following Single Port Architecture
6. **Component Integration**: Integration with other Tekton components

## Using Existing Code

The implementation will build upon:

- `execution_models.py`: Execution data models and enums
- `execution_engine.py`: Core execution engine scaffold
- `execution_step.py`: Step execution implementation
- `phase_models.py`: Phase definition models
- `condition_evaluator.py`: Condition evaluation logic
- `integration_base.py`: Base integration classes
- `integration_adapters.py`: Component adapter implementations
- `integration.py`: Integration management

## Leveraging Shared Utilities

The implementation will use all ten shared utilities:

- HTTP client for API integration
- Configuration management for settings
- Logging for structured execution logs
- WebSocket management for real-time updates
- Hermes registration for component discovery
- Error handling for standardized errors
- Component lifecycle for proper management
- Authentication for API security
- Context management for execution tracking
- CLI for command-line interface

## Areas Needing Special Attention

Several areas require special focus during implementation:

1. **Integration Flexibility**: The integration system must support diverse external systems (CLI, API, MCP) with a unified interface while handling different protocols and data formats.

2. **Execution State Management**: The engine must reliably track execution state across steps, handle pausing/resuming, and recover from failures, requiring careful state design and persistence.

3. **Step Dependency Resolution**: Complex workflows with conditional paths, loops, and parallel execution require sophisticated dependency resolution and scheduling algorithms.

4. **Variable Substitution and Expressions**: The engine needs a robust expression evaluation system for conditions, variable manipulation, and dynamic substitution.

5. **Error Handling and Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate retry policies, recovery strategies, and failure notifications is critical.

6. **Performance Optimization**: The execution engine must be efficient with minimal overhead, particularly for complex workflows with many steps.

7. **Security Considerations**: Integration with external systems requires careful credential management, input validation, and permission checking.

8. **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket implementation for real-time execution updates requires efficient event propagation and connection management.

## Potential Shared Utilities

During implementation, look for patterns that could become shared utilities:

- Process execution engine abstractions
- Integration adapter framework
- Event system for execution monitoring
- Expression evaluation engine
- CLI execution framework

## Claude Code Session Execution

When executing the Claude Code session:

1. Start by asking Claude to review the IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md, DELIVERABLES.md, and PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
2. Have Claude examine the existing code to understand current implementation
3. Follow the implementation sequence in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
4. Focus first on core models, engine, and integration system
5. Implement and test components incrementally
6. Ensure all deliverables are completed
7. Verify integration with other Tekton components
8. Update the Tekton roadmap upon completion

## Final Verification

Before completing the sprint, ensure:
- All items in DELIVERABLES.md are checked
- All API endpoints are implemented and tested
- UI component is functional in Hephaestus
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Tests have good coverage
- Integration with other components is working
- Roadmap is updated to reflect completion
