# GlobalConfig Sprint

## Overview

This sprint implements a unified global configuration system for all Tekton components, replacing the current pattern of multiple global variables with a single, centralized configuration object that is loaded once at component startup.

## Sprint Status

**Status**: Planning  
**Start Date**: June 12, 2025  
**Architect Claude**: Planning Phase  
**Working Claude**: Not Yet Started  

## Problem Statement

Currently, Tekton components use multiple global variables to store configuration and state:
- Individual port variables (e.g., `rhetor_port`)
- Component status flags (e.g., `is_registered_with_hermes`)
- Service references (e.g., `llm_client`, `budget_manager`)
- Timestamps and metrics (e.g., `start_time`)

This approach leads to:
- Scattered configuration management
- Difficulty tracking component state
- Error-prone global variable management
- Inconsistent configuration patterns across components

## Sprint Goals

1. **Create a unified GlobalConfig class** that encapsulates all component configuration and state
2. **Standardize configuration loading** across all Tekton components
3. **Improve configuration access patterns** with a single source of truth
4. **Enhance maintainability** by reducing global variable sprawl
5. **Ensure backward compatibility** during the transition

## Affected Components

All Tekton components will be updated:
- Apollo
- Athena
- Aura
- Budget
- Chronos
- CognitoFlux
- Hermes
- Noesis
- Rhetor
- Telos

## Success Criteria

- [ ] GlobalConfig class implemented in shared utilities
- [ ] All components updated to use GlobalConfig
- [ ] No individual global configuration variables remain
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Improved configuration access patterns documented
- [ ] All tests passing
