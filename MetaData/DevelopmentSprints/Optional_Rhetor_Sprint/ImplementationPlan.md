# Optional Rhetor Sprint - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Optional Rhetor Sprint Development Sprint. It breaks down the high-level goals into specific implementation tasks, defines the phasing, specifies testing requirements, and identifies documentation that must be updated.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Implementation Plan focuses on production readiness, monitoring, and advanced orchestration patterns based on real-world usage experience.

## Debug Instrumentation Requirements

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md). This section specifies the debug instrumentation requirements for this sprint's implementation.

### JavaScript Components

The following JavaScript components must be instrumented:

| Component | Log Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Authentication UI | INFO | Login/logout events, permission checks |
| Monitoring Dashboard | DEBUG | Metric updates, chart rendering |
| Cross-Component Integration | TRACE | Message routing, component status |

All instrumentation must use conditional checks:

```javascript
if (window.TektonDebug) TektonDebug.info('rhetor-auth', 'Authentication successful', { userId, permissions });
```

### Python Components

The following Python components must be instrumented:

| Component | Log Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Security Module | INFO | Authentication events, authorization decisions |
| Monitoring System | DEBUG | Metric collection, health check execution |
| Cross-Component Integration | TRACE | Message bus interactions, component discovery |
| Orchestration Engine | INFO | Workflow execution, specialist coordination |

All instrumentation must use the `debug_log` utility:

```python
from shared.debug.debug_utils import debug_log, log_function

debug_log.info("rhetor_security", "User authenticated", {"user_id": user_id, "permissions": permissions})
```

Key methods should use the `@log_function` decorator:

```python
@log_function()
def authenticate_user(api_key: str) -> Optional[User]:
    # Authentication implementation
```
