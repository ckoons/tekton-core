# Optional Rhetor Sprint - Sprint-Specific Guidance

## Overview

This is a deferred sprint that contains features identified during the main Rhetor AI Integration Sprint but deferred based on the need for real-world experience with Phase 4A (Streaming) and Phase 4B (Dynamic Specialist Creation) implementations.

## Sprint Context

This sprint follows the completion of the main Rhetor AI Integration Sprint, which successfully delivered:
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Cross-Component Integration with live AISpecialistManager
- ‚úÖ Phase 4A: Real-Time Streaming Support  
- ‚úÖ Phase 4B: Dynamic Specialist Creation

## Experience-Based Decision Making

This sprint represents a commitment to evidence-based development rather than premature optimization. After several days of real usage with streaming AI interactions and dynamic specialist creation, the actual production needs can be properly assessed.

## Sprint Dependencies

This sprint can only begin after:
1. Main Rhetor AI Integration Sprint is complete
2. Phase 4A and 4B have been deployed and used in production
3. Performance metrics and usage patterns have been collected
4. Actual pain points and optimization opportunities have been identified

## Deferred Items Priority

### Phase 5: Production Readiness & Integration ‚è∏Ô∏è **Not Started**
- **Status**: Awaiting real-world usage data
- **Trigger**: Performance issues or production requirements identified
- **Priority**: High when triggered

### Phase 4C: Advanced Orchestration Patterns üí≠ **Optional for Discussion**
- **Status**: Theoretical - needs validation through usage
- **Trigger**: Complex orchestration patterns emerge from real usage
- **Priority**: Low unless specific use cases emerge

## Success Metrics for Sprint Activation

This sprint should be activated when one or more of the following occurs:

1. **Security Requirements**: Production deployment requires authentication/authorization
2. **Performance Issues**: Response times exceed acceptable thresholds
3. **Monitoring Needs**: Debugging production issues requires better observability
4. **Cross-Component Demand**: Other Tekton components need Rhetor orchestration
5. **Complex Patterns**: Users create orchestration patterns that current tools can't handle

## Guidelines for Future Implementation

When this sprint is activated:

1. **Review Current State**: Analyze metrics and usage patterns from production
2. **Prioritize by Impact**: Focus on features that solve actual user pain points
3. **Maintain Architecture**: Build on the solid foundation from the main sprint
4. **Validate Assumptions**: Test theoretical features with real use cases

## Documentation Maintenance

This sprint's documentation should be updated based on:
- Production metrics and performance data
- User feedback and feature requests
- Identified security or monitoring requirements
- Evolving integration needs with other Tekton components
