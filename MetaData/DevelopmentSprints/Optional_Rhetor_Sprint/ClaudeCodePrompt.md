# Optional Rhetor Sprint - Claude Code Initial Prompt

## Sprint Context

You are working on the **Optional Rhetor Sprint**, a deferred Development Sprint that implements production readiness and advanced orchestration features for the Rhetor AI orchestration system.

## Prerequisites

This sprint can only begin after:
1. ✅ Main Rhetor AI Integration Sprint completed (Phases 3, 4A, 4B)
2. ✅ Real-world usage data collected from streaming and dynamic specialist features
3. ✅ Production requirements identified through actual deployment needs
4. ✅ Performance metrics and usage patterns analyzed

## Sprint Objectives

Implement evidence-based production features:

### Phase 5: Production Readiness & Monitoring ⏸️ **Not Started**
- **Security**: API key authentication, role-based authorization, audit logging
- **Monitoring**: Health checks, performance metrics, operational dashboards
- **Configuration**: Production deployment, secrets management, environment handling
- **Observability**: Real-time system visibility and alerting

### Phase 6: Cross-Component Integration ⏸️ **Not Started**  
- **Hermes Enhancement**: Typed interfaces, reliable message routing
- **Orchestration Tools**: MCP tools for multi-component workflows
- **Unified Interface**: Single control point for entire Tekton ecosystem
- **Integration**: Apollo task planning, Engram memory, Prometheus strategy

### Phase 4C: Advanced Orchestration 💭 **Optional for Discussion**
- **Workflow Engine**: Pluggable architecture for complex patterns
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-specialist concurrent processing  
- **Load Balancing**: Performance-based intelligent routing
- **Pattern Implementation**: Only if validated through real usage

## Current Architecture Foundation

Building on the successful main sprint:
- ✅ Live MCP tools connected to AISpecialistManager
- ✅ Real-time streaming AI interactions via SSE
- ✅ Dynamic specialist creation and configuration
- ✅ Robust FastMCP server with coroutine handling
- ✅ 22 functional MCP tools across 4 capability domains

## Key Technical Context

### Existing Integration Points
- **MCPToolsIntegration**: `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/mcp/tools_integration.py`
- **FastMCP Endpoints**: `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py`
- **AISpecialistManager**: `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/ai_specialist_manager.py`
- **Hermes Integration**: Already functional for cross-component messaging

### Critical Architecture Decisions
- **Evidence-Based Development**: Implement only features validated by real usage
- **Layered Security**: API keys + RBAC + audit logging for production
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Health checks + metrics + dashboards
- **Pluggable Orchestration**: Architecture that can accommodate workflow engines when needed

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Requirements

**Debug Instrumentation** (MANDATORY):
```python
from shared.debug.debug_utils import debug_log, log_function

@log_function()
def authenticate_user(api_key: str) -> Optional[User]:
    debug_log.info("rhetor_security", "Authentication attempt", {"api_key_hash": hash(api_key)})
```

```javascript
if (window.TektonDebug) TektonDebug.info('rhetor-auth', 'Login successful', { userId, permissions });
```

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests for security, monitoring, and orchestration components
- Integration tests for cross-component workflows
- Performance tests for scalability validation
- Security penetration testing

### Phase Implementation Order

1. **Start with Phase 5** if production requirements are validated
2. **Move to Phase 6** if cross-component integration is needed
3. **Consider Phase 4C** only if complex orchestration patterns are proven necessary

### Decision Validation

Before implementing any phase:
1. Review production metrics and usage data
2. Confirm specific requirements with stakeholder feedback
3. Validate architectural decisions against real-world constraints
4. Ensure features solve actual user pain points, not theoretical problems

## File Locations

Key implementation areas:
```
/Rhetor/rhetor/core/security.py              # Authentication & authorization
/Rhetor/rhetor/core/monitoring.py            # Health checks & metrics
/Rhetor/rhetor/core/cross_component_integration.py  # Enhanced Hermes
/Rhetor/rhetor/api/auth_middleware.py        # FastAPI auth middleware
/Rhetor/rhetor/api/health_endpoints.py       # Health check endpoints
/Hephaestus/ui/scripts/monitoring-dashboard.js  # Operational UI
```

## Testing Commands

Validation commands to run:
```bash
# Test existing functionality still works
python /Rhetor/tests/test_mcp_integration.py

# Validate security implementation
pytest /Rhetor/tests/security/

# Check monitoring endpoints
curl http://localhost:8003/api/health/status

# Test cross-component integration
python /Rhetor/tests/integration/test_cross_component.py
```

## Success Criteria

The sprint succeeds when:
- ✅ Production deployment is secure and monitored
- ✅ Cross-component integration enables complex Tekton workflows  
- ✅ All features solve validated user problems
- ✅ Performance meets established baseline metrics
- ✅ Security audit passes without critical issues
- ✅ Operational staff can effectively manage the system

## Important Notes

- **Don't implement Phase 4C unless specific patterns are proven necessary**
- **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing MCP tools and streaming features
- **Build on existing foundation** rather than rewriting working systems
- **Prioritize based on evidence** from production usage, not theoretical needs
