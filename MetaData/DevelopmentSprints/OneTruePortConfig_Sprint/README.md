# OneTruePortConfig Sprint

## Sprint Status: Planning Phase
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: TBD  
**Branch**: sprint/OneTruePortConfig

## Overview
This sprint addresses the critical need for centralized port configuration management across all Tekton components. Currently, port configurations are scattered throughout the codebase with hardcoded fallbacks, making the system fragile and difficult to maintain.

## Sprint Objectives
1. Create a single source of truth for all port configurations
2. Eliminate all hardcoded port values from component code
3. Establish consistent patterns for port access across all components
4. Enable reliable service discovery between components
5. Document and standardize port configuration practices

## Current Progress
- [ ] Sprint Planning
- [ ] Architectural Decisions
- [ ] Implementation Plan
- [ ] Implementation Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implementation Phase 2: Component Migration
- [ ] Implementation Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Documentation Updates
- [ ] Retrospective

## Key Challenges
- Multiple patterns for port configuration currently exist
- Cross-component communication lacks standardization
- Backwards compatibility during migration
- Ensuring zero downtime during transition

## Success Metrics
- All components start successfully with centralized configuration
- No hardcoded port values remain in codebase
- Service discovery works reliably between all components
- Clear documentation for adding new components
- All existing tests pass with new configuration

## Notes for Implementation
This sprint will touch every component in Tekton but in a systematic way. The implementing Claude should propose a migration strategy that minimizes risk while ensuring completeness.
