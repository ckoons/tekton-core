# Session 4 Progress Summary

## Starting State
- 9/14 components working (64%)
- 5 components failing: Rhetor, Harmonia, Telos, Sophia, Budget

## Fixes Completed

### Initial Round (5 components)
1. **Rhetor** ✅
   - Fixed: `input_schema` → `schema` in MCPTool definitions (sed replacement)
   - Issue: Pydantic validation error on missing 'schema' field

2. **Harmonia** ✅
   - Fixed: Added root "/" endpoint returning component info
   - Issue: 404 errors causing health check failures

3. **Telos** ❌ (Partial)
   - Fixed: Removed invalid `--port` command line argument from launch script
   - Issue: Complete failure to start, no log file created

4. **Sophia** ✅
   - Fixed: `asyncio.coroutine` → `Awaitable[Any]` type annotations
   - Issue: Deprecated Python 3.10+ feature causing AttributeError

5. **Budget** ✅
   - Fixed: Removed `@log_function()` decorator from async endpoints
   - Fixed: Removed incorrect `await` on synchronous `get_budget_engine()`
   - Issue: Coroutine/async decoration conflicts

### Second Round (3 remaining)
1. **Rhetor** ✅
   - Fixed: Commented out manual MCPTool creation lists
   - Fixed: Added missing closing triple quotes (""") in tools.py
   - Issue: Tools were being manually created instead of using @mcp_tool decorators

2. **Sophia** ✅
   - Fixed: String concatenation indentation error with parentheses wrapping
   - Issue: Unexpected indent in llm_integration.py line 531

3. **Telos** ⚠️
   - Issue: Startup hanging, likely due to deprecated @app.on_event("startup")
   - Status: Requires deeper investigation

## Final Results
- **13/14 components working (93%)**
- Only Telos remains problematic with startup hanging issues

## Components Status:
✅ Hermes
✅ Engram  
✅ Ergon (with MCP registration errors)
✅ Prometheus
✅ Harmonia
✅ Synthesis
✅ Athena
✅ Metis
✅ Apollo
✅ Budget
✅ Rhetor
✅ Sophia
✅ Hephaestus UI
❌ Telos (startup hang)

## Key Patterns Fixed:
1. Pydantic schema field naming inconsistencies
2. Missing API endpoints for health checks
3. Python 3.10+ deprecated features (asyncio.coroutine)
4. Async/await decoration conflicts
5. String literal syntax errors
6. Command line argument mismatches

## Remaining Issues:
- Telos startup hang (deprecated event handler)
- Ergon MCP tool registration errors (non-blocking)
- Some components still showing timeout warnings during launch
