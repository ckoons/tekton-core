# Session 9 Complete Handoff - GoodLaunch Sprint

## Sprint Status: 75% Complete

### What Was Accomplished in Session 9

#### Phase 2: Component Registration and Communication ✅ COMPLETE
- Implemented Hermes registration for remaining components (Apollo, Prometheus, Telos, Metis, Harmonia, Ergon)
- Fixed Hermes API endpoints in registration utility
- Created `/api/components` endpoint for listing registered components
- Updated status script to query Hermes for registration status

#### Phase 3: Python Launch System ✅ COMPLETE
- Created `tekton-launch.py` - full Python replacement for bash script
- Created `tekton-kill.py` - graceful shutdown with cleanup
- Fixed macOS permission issues using lsof and socket binding
- Scripts work from any directory
- Parallel launching already implemented within priority groups
- Successfully launches 15/16 components

### Issues Found (Low Priority)
1. **Apollo**: python-dotenv parsing error at line 74
2. **Engram**: Shows unhealthy status when running
3. **Hermes**: Occasional timeout issues in health checks

### Next Session Priority: Phase 5 - UI Status Integration

Since Phase 4 (parallel optimization) is already implemented in the launch script, the next session should focus on Phase 5.

## Next Session Prompt

```
You are continuing the GoodLaunch Sprint for the Tekton project. The sprint is 75% complete with Phases 1-3 fully done and Phase 4 (parallel launch) already implemented in the launch script.

Your main task is Phase 5: UI Status Integration
1. Add status dots to Hephaestus navigation tabs
2. Implement real-time status updates (WebSocket or polling)
3. Show component health and registration status
4. Test the complete system end-to-end

Key files:
- Launch script: /scripts/tekton-launch.py (COMPLETE)
- Kill script: /scripts/tekton-kill.py (COMPLETE)
- Status script: /scripts/tekton-status.py (queries Hermes)
- Hephaestus UI: /Hephaestus/ui/index.html

The launch system is working well - it launches 15/16 components successfully in ~24 seconds using parallel execution within priority groups.

Low priority issues to fix if time permits:
- Apollo: python-dotenv parsing error
- Engram: unhealthy status
- Hermes: timeout issues

Success metrics:
1. Status dots show real-time component health
2. Registration status visible in UI
3. All 14 main components launching successfully
4. Complete documentation of the sprint results
```

## Technical Details for Handoff

### Working Launch Commands
```bash
# Launch all components
./scripts/tekton-launch.py --components all --non-interactive

# Launch specific components
./scripts/tekton-launch.py --components hermes,engram,rhetor

# Kill all components
./scripts/tekton-kill.py

# Check status
./scripts/tekton-status.py
```

### Component Health Endpoints
All components now follow standardized format:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "component": "component_name",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "port": 8001,
  "message": "Component is running normally"
}
```

### Hermes Registration Status
Query via: `GET http://localhost:8001/api/components`

### Launch Performance
- Sequential launch: ~10 seconds for 3 components
- Parallel launch: Already implemented, launches same-priority components simultaneously
- Total time for all components: ~24 seconds

## Sprint Completion Estimate
With Phase 5 being primarily UI work, the sprint should be completable in 1-2 more sessions. The heavy lifting (import fixes, registration system, launch scripts) is done. What remains is connecting the existing status information to the Hephaestus UI.
