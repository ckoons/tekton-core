# Session 8 Prompt - Continuing GoodLaunch Sprint

## Current Sprint Status

You are continuing the GoodLaunch Sprint. Session 7 made significant progress enhancing core components. The sprint has 5 phases, and we're currently transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2.

### What's Been Completed

#### Session 7 Achievements:
1. **Rhetor Enhancement** ✅
   - Full multi-provider LLM support (6 providers working)
   - Intelligent task-based routing
   - Component context management system
   - Real `/complete` endpoint with actual LLM responses
   - Location: `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/app_enhanced.py`

2. **Sophia Enhancement** ✅
   - Real-time component health monitoring (30-second updates)
   - Health → IQ score mapping with specialization bonuses
   - Multi-dimensional intelligence assessment
   - System IQ: 131.8 (12/14 components healthy)
   - Location: `/Sophia/sophia/api/app_enhanced.py`

3. **Graceful Shutdown Design** ✅
   - Created shutdown handler template
   - Added to Rhetor and Sophia (path issues need fixing)
   - Location: `/shared/utils/graceful_shutdown.py`

### Current Component Status
- **All 14 components launching successfully**
- Rhetor: Enhanced with real LLM orchestration
- Sophia: Enhanced with real intelligence measurement
- Others: Still using original or simplified versions

## Phase Status Overview

### ✅ Phase 1: Import Resolution and Health Fixes (90% Complete)
**Remaining:**
- Standardize health check format across ALL components
- Fix Pydantic warnings in Budget and other components

### ⏳ Phase 2: Component Registration and Communication (Starting Now)
**Tasks:**
1. Ensure all components register with Hermes on startup
2. Standardize `/health` endpoints to include registration status
3. Verify inter-component communication through Hermes
4. Test component lifecycle management

### ⏳ Phase 3: Python Launch System (0% Complete)
**Tasks:**
1. Create `tekton-launch.py` to replace bash script
2. Create `tekton-status.py` with enhanced reporting
3. Create `tekton-kill.py` with proper cleanup
4. Ensure cross-platform compatibility

### ⏳ Phase 4: Parallel Launch Implementation (0% Complete)
**Tasks:**
1. Implement dependency graph (Hermes→Engram→Rhetor sequential)
2. Launch other components in parallel
3. Target 50% startup time reduction
4. Handle failures gracefully

### ⏳ Phase 5: UI Status Integration (0% Complete)
**Tasks:**
1. Add status dots to Hephaestus navigation
2. Implement WebSocket status updates
3. Provide detailed component information

## Session 8 Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Graceful Shutdown Path Issue
The import path for `graceful_shutdown.py` needs fixing:
```python
# Current (not working):
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '../../../../shared/utils'))

# Should be adjusted based on actual path structure
```

### 2. Standardize Health Endpoints (Phase 1 Completion)
Create a standard health response format:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "x.x.x", 
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "component": "component-name",
  "port": 8000,
  "registered_with_hermes": true,
  "details": {
    // Component-specific details
  }
}
```

Apply to at least 5 components to establish the pattern.

### 3. Begin Hermes Registration (Phase 2)
Components should register on startup:
```python
async def register_with_hermes():
    """Register this component with Hermes"""
    # POST to http://localhost:8001/api/components/register
    # Include: name, port, capabilities, health_endpoint
```

Start with Rhetor and Sophia, then add to 3 more components.

### 4. Start Python Launch System (Phase 3)
Begin with `tekton-status.py`:
- Query all component health endpoints
- Show registration status
- Display in a clean table format
- Include system resource usage

## Key Files and Patterns

### Enhanced Components
- `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/app_enhanced.py` - Full LLM orchestration
- `/Sophia/sophia/api/app_enhanced.py` - Intelligence measurement

### Patterns to Follow
1. **Enhancement Pattern**: Create `app_enhanced.py`, then import in `app_simple.py`
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Use the template from Session7_Progress.md
3. **Health Endpoints**: Standardize across all components
4. **Logging**: Use component-specific loggers

### Component Ports
```python
COMPONENT_PORTS = {
    "engram": 8000, "hermes": 8001, "ergon": 8002, "rhetor": 8003,
    "athena": 8005, "prometheus": 8006, "harmonia": 8007, "telos": 8008,
    "synthesis": 8009, "metis": 8011, "apollo": 8012, "budget": 8013,
    "sophia": 8014, "hephaestus": 8080
}
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check all components running
./scripts/tekton-status

# Test Rhetor completion
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello", "context_id": "test", "task_type": "simple"}'

# Test Sophia intelligence
curl http://localhost:8014/api/intelligence/metrics

# Test component health
curl http://localhost:8003/health
```

## Important Notes

1. **Maintain 100% Launch Rate**: Don't break what's working
2. **Incremental Progress**: Complete tasks step by step
3. **Test Everything**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Document Progress**: Update Session8_Progress.md as you go

## Success Metrics for Session 8

1. ✅ Graceful shutdown working in at least 2 components
2. ✅ Health endpoints standardized in at least 5 components
3. ✅ Hermes registration working for at least 3 components
4. ✅ Basic Python status script created and working
