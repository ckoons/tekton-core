# GoodLaunch Sprint - Session 2 Progress Report

## Phase 1 Fixes Completed

### 1. Fixed BaseModel Schema Shadow Warnings ✅
- Updated field names that were shadowing parent BaseModel attributes
- Changed `schema` to `input_schema` with alias in:
  - `/tekton-core/tekton/mcp/fastmcp/schema.py` - `ToolSchema` class
  - `/Apollo/apollo/models/protocol.py` - `ProtocolDefinition` class
  - `/Hermes/hermes/api/mcp_endpoints.py` - `ToolSpec` class

### 2. Added TimelineEvent Class ✅
- Created `TimelineEvent` class in `/Prometheus/prometheus/models/timeline.py`
- Implemented as a Pydantic BaseModel with proper fields for timeline event tracking
- Resolved import error in prometheus MCP tools

### 3. Added get_budget_engine Function ✅
- Added `get_budget_engine()` function to `/Budget/budget/core/engine.py`
- Returns the singleton BudgetEngine instance
- Resolved import error in Budget startup

### 4. Fixed Name Errors in Rhetor ✅
- Fixed capability registration in `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py`
- Changed from passing classes to passing instances:
  - `LLMManagementCapability()` instead of `LLMManagementCapability`
  - `PromptEngineeringCapability()` instead of `PromptEngineeringCapability`
  - `ContextManagementCapability()` instead of `ContextManagementCapability`

### 5. Fixed Name Errors in Synthesis ✅
- Fixed capability registration in `/Synthesis/synthesis/api/fastmcp_endpoints.py`
- Changed from passing classes to passing instances:
  - `DataSynthesisCapability()` instead of `DataSynthesisCapability`
  - `IntegrationOrchestrationCapability()` instead of `IntegrationOrchestrationCapability`
  - `WorkflowCompositionCapability()` instead of `WorkflowCompositionCapability`

### 6. Fixed Athena Entity Class Issues ✅
- Added `Config` class with `arbitrary_types_allowed = True` to Pydantic models in:
  - `/Athena/athena/api/models/llm.py`:
    - `KnowledgeContextResponse`
    - `KnowledgeChatResponse`
    - `EntityExtractionResponse`
    - `RelationshipInferenceResponse`
  - `/Athena/athena/api/models/visualization.py`:
    - `GraphVisualizationResponse`
    - `SubgraphResponse`

### 7. Pydantic v2 Config Warnings ⚠️
- The `allow_population_by_field_name` warnings appear to be coming from third-party libraries
- No instances found in the Tekton codebase itself
- This is a known issue with libraries that haven't fully migrated to Pydantic v2

## Current Status

All Phase 1 fixes have been completed except for the Pydantic v2 warnings which are coming from external dependencies.

### Components Expected to Work Now:
- ✅ Hermes (already working)
- ✅ Engram (already working)
- ✅ Apollo (already working)
- ✅ Rhetor (fixed name errors)
- ✅ Synthesis (fixed name errors)
- ✅ Prometheus (added TimelineEvent)
- ✅ Budget (added get_budget_engine)
- ✅ Athena (fixed arbitrary_types_allowed)

### Remaining Issues:
- Telos - Failed to start (needs investigation)
- Sophia - asyncio.coroutine error (needs investigation)
- Metis - 'function' object has no attribute 'name' (needs investigation)
- Harmonia - Timeout (needs investigation)
- Ergon - Timeout (needs investigation)

## Next Steps

1. Run `tekton-launch --launch-all` to verify fixes
2. Investigate remaining component failures
3. Begin Phase 2: Component Registration and Communication

## Code Quality

All fixes followed best practices:
- Maintained backward compatibility with aliases
- Added proper type annotations
- Preserved existing functionality
- Used appropriate Pydantic patterns
