# GoodLaunch Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the GoodLaunch Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on component reliability, launch system robustness, and lifecycle management across the entire ecosystem.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Reliable Component Launch**: Eliminate all import errors and startup failures preventing components from launching successfully
2. **Modern Launch Infrastructure**: Replace bash scripts with robust Python programs that provide better error handling and cross-platform compatibility  
3. **Efficient Parallel Execution**: Implement intelligent parallel launching while respecting component dependencies
4. **Real-time Status Feedback**: Integrate component status into the Hephaestus UI with visual indicators and detailed health information
5. **Production-Ready Lifecycle Management**: Ensure components properly register, communicate, and maintain healthy status throughout their lifecycle

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Increased Reliability**: Eliminates startup failures that prevent users from accessing Tekton functionality
- **Better Developer Experience**: Clear error messages and status feedback reduce troubleshooting time
- **Faster Time-to-Value**: Parallel launching reduces system startup time by 50%+ 
- **Operational Visibility**: Real-time UI status enables quick identification of component issues
- **Platform Independence**: Python-based launch system works consistently across different operating systems
- **Maintainability**: Structured error handling and logging make the system easier to debug and maintain

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The current launch system is based on bash scripts (`tekton-launch`, `tekton-status`, `tekton-kill`) that provide basic component launching capabilities. While functional, the system has several limitations:

- **Sequential launching**: All components launch one after another, resulting in slow startup times
- **Inconsistent error handling**: Some failures are masked or reported incorrectly
- **Import dependency issues**: Multiple components fail to start due to missing imports or circular dependencies
- **Limited status visibility**: Status checking provides basic information but lacks real-time updates
- **Platform-specific behavior**: Bash scripts may behave differently across operating systems

### Pain Points

Current pain points in the launch system include:

1. **Import Errors**: Multiple components fail with import errors for missing classes/functions
2. **False Success Reporting**: Components that fail to start are sometimes reported as successful
3. **Long Startup Times**: Sequential launching takes 2-3 minutes for full system startup
4. **Poor Error Messages**: Users receive generic timeout messages instead of specific failure reasons
5. **No Visual Feedback**: Users must manually check status; no real-time updates in the UI
6. **Pydantic v2 Warnings**: Extensive deprecation warnings clutter the output and may indicate compatibility issues

## Proposed Approach

The sprint will take a phased approach to systematically address each issue area while maintaining system stability:

### Key Components Affected

- **All Tekton Components**: Import resolution and startup health checks
- **Launch Infrastructure**: Complete rewrite from bash to Python  
- **Hermes Service Registry**: Enhanced to track component lifecycle
- **Hephaestus UI**: Addition of real-time status indicators
- **MCP Integration**: Standardization of MCP endpoint patterns across components

### Technical Approach

The technical approach emphasizes reliability, observability, and maintainability:

1. **Import Resolution**: Systematic analysis and resolution of all missing dependencies
2. **Health Check Standardization**: Implement consistent health endpoints across all components
3. **Dependency Management**: Clear ordering of component startup based on actual dependencies
4. **Python Launch System**: Modern process management with structured error handling
5. **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based status updates between launch system and UI
6. **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed debug instrumentation following established patterns

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

This instrumentation will enable efficient debugging and diagnostics without impacting performance when disabled.

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Class and method documentation with clear purpose statements
- API contracts and parameter descriptions
- Requirements for component initialization
- Error handling strategy

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Major architectural changes to individual components
- Performance optimization beyond launch time improvements
- New feature development in existing components
- Database schema migrations
- Authentication or security enhancements
- Comprehensive Pydantic v2 migration (only critical fixes)

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Current branch `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125` must remain stable
- No concurrent major changes to core component APIs
- Hermes service registry functionality must remain available
- Hephaestus UI framework must support real-time updates

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 5 phases:

### Phase 1: Import Resolution and Health Fixes
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Resolve all import errors and timeout issues preventing component startup
- **Key Deliverables**: All components start without import errors, health checks respond correctly

### Phase 2: Component Registration and Communication  
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Ensure all components properly register with Hermes and maintain healthy status
- **Key Deliverables**: 100% component registration rate, reliable inter-component communication

### Phase 3: Python Launch System Development
- **Duration**: 2-3 days  
- **Focus**: Create robust Python replacements for bash scripts with better error handling
- **Key Deliverables**: `tekton-launch.py`, `tekton-status.py`, `tekton-kill.py` fully functional

### Phase 4: Parallel Launch Implementation
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Implement intelligent parallel launching while respecting dependencies
- **Key Deliverables**: System startup time reduced by 50%+, dependency ordering maintained

### Phase 5: UI Status Integration
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Add real-time component status indicators to Hephaestus UI
- **Key Deliverables**: Visual status dots, detailed component information, real-time updates

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Import circular dependencies | High | Medium | Systematic dependency analysis, careful refactoring order |
| Component startup interactions | Medium | Medium | Isolated testing of each component, careful dependency ordering |
| Python script platform compatibility | Low | Low | Use standard library where possible, test on multiple platforms |
| UI framework limitations | Medium | Low | Leverage existing WebSocket infrastructure, incremental implementation |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Performance testing before and after changes, careful resource management |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- All components launch without import errors or timeouts
- System startup time is reduced by at least 50%
- Python launch scripts successfully replace bash scripts
- UI provides real-time component status with visual indicators
- Component registration with Hermes reaches 100%
- All code follows the Debug Instrumentation Guidelines
- Documentation is complete and accurate  
- Tests pass with 90%+ coverage for new code
