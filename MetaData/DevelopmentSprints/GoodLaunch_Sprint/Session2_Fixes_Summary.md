# GoodLaunch Sprint - Session 2 Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ToolSchema Field Name Updates ✅
- Changed `parameters` to `input_schema` in all MCPTool definitions
- Updated tools.py files in: Rhetor, Synthesis, Sophia, Terma
- Updated server.py to use `input_schema` instead of `schema`
- Properly wrapped parameters in the expected structure:
  ```python
  input_schema={"parameters": {...}, "return_type": {"type": "object"}}
  ```

### 2. Capability Registration ✅  
- Fixed capability registration to use instances instead of classes
- Updated in: Rhetor, Synthesis, Metis
- Changed from `register_capability(CapabilityClass)` to `register_capability(CapabilityClass())`

### 3. Missing Classes/Functions ✅
- Added `ResourceAllocation` class to `prometheus/models/resource.py`
- Added `get_budget_engine()` function to `budget/core/engine.py`  
- Created placeholder content for empty `metis/core/mcp/tools.py`

### 4. API Compatibility Issues ✅
- Fixed `TektonLLMClient` initialization in Athena
- Changed from `TektonLLMClient(settings=...)` to individual parameters
- Removed `ClientSettings` usage in favor of direct parameters

### 5. Decorator Issues ✅
- Fixed `log_function` decorator usage in Budget
- Changed from `@log_function(operation="...")` to `@log_function(level="INFO")`
- Updated all occurrences in budget/api/mcp_endpoints.py

### 6. Python 3.12 Compatibility ✅
- Fixed `asyncio.coroutine` usage in tekton_websocket.py
- Changed type annotation to use `Any` instead of deprecated `asyncio.coroutine`

## Remaining Issues

### Telos
- Failed to start but no log file created
- Needs investigation of the launch script

### Harmonia & Ergon  
- Both timing out during startup
- May need to check if they're trying to connect to services that aren't running

### Other Components
- Most components should now start without the previous errors
- May still have runtime issues that need addressing

## Key Observations

1. **Consistency Issues**: Different components had similar issues but implemented differently
2. **Version Compatibility**: Mix of Pydantic v1 and v2 patterns causing issues
3. **Empty Implementations**: Some components (like Metis) have empty tool implementations
4. **Deprecated APIs**: Several components using outdated Python/library APIs

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. Run `tekton-launch --launch-all` again to see improved results
2. Focus on components that now start but have runtime issues
3. Create a sprint for Pydantic v2/v3 migration
4. Standardize MCP tool/capability registration patterns
5. Review and update deprecated API usage across all components
