# CleanRequirements Development Sprint

## Overview

This Development Sprint focuses on comprehensive dependency optimization across all Tekton components to resolve version conflicts, eliminate redundant dependencies, and improve system reliability. The sprint addresses critical version conflicts (particularly Pydantic compatibility issues), massive dependency duplication, and establishes sustainable dependency management practices.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This sprint ensures all components can work together reliably by standardizing dependencies, eliminating conflicts, and reducing the overall dependency footprint by 60-70%.

## Sprint Status

**✅ Phase 1: COMPLETED (2025-05-21)**
- All critical version conflicts resolved
- System successfully launching all 14 components
- Ready for testing period before Phase 2

**📋 Phase 2: READY (Awaiting Testing)**

## Sprint Branch

This sprint uses the branch `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125`.

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Dependency Consolidation Over Duplication**: Eliminate redundant dependencies through shared packages
2. **Version Standardization**: Resolve all version conflicts with standardized dependency specifications
3. **Production/Development Separation**: Clean separation of runtime vs development dependencies
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Optional heavy dependencies with fallback implementations
5. **Sustainable Maintenance**: Centralized dependency management for long-term maintainability
6. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce install times, disk usage, and memory footprint

## Problem Statement

Current critical issues preventing reliable system operation:

### Version Conflicts (System Breaking)
- **Pydantic**: 1.9.0 → 2.10.6 across components causing inter-component communication failures
- **Anthropic**: 0.5.0 → 0.10.0 with significant API differences
- **WebSockets**: 10.3 → 11.0.3 with major version incompatibilities

### Massive Dependency Duplication
- **Vector Processing Stack**: `faiss-cpu`, `sentence-transformers`, `torch` duplicated across 3+ components (~6GB redundant)
- **Data Science Stack**: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy` duplicated across 4+ components (~2GB redundant)
- **Web Framework Stack**: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic` with different versions across 15+ components

### Dependency Management Issues
- Missing version pinning causing instability
- Development dependencies mixed with production requirements
- Redundant package installations (e.g., Engram's double Flask-Bootstrap dependencies)
- Loose version constraints (`>=`) leading to unpredictable behavior

## Success Criteria

1. **Zero Version Conflicts**: All components use compatible dependency versions
2. **60-70% Dependency Footprint Reduction**: Through consolidation and deduplication
3. **Standardized Dependency Management**: Centralized shared requirements with clear versioning
4. **Successful System Launch**: All components launch without dependency-related errors
5. **Performance Improvement**: Faster install times and reduced disk/memory usage
6. **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear dependency ownership and upgrade paths

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Conflict Resolution ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Fixed Pydantic version conflicts across all components (2.5.0 standard)
- ✅ Standardized Anthropic (0.10.0) and WebSocket library versions (11.0.3)
- ✅ Resolved immediate breaking dependency issues
- ✅ Updated 43+ API calls for Pydantic v2 compatibility
- ✅ System successfully launches all 14 components

### Phase 2: Dependency Consolidation
- Create shared requirements packages for common dependency stacks
- Consolidate vector processing dependencies into single packages
- Eliminate redundant web framework installations

### Phase 3: Architecture Optimization
- Separate production and development dependencies
- Implement optional dependency patterns for heavy libraries
- Create dependency injection patterns for better modularity

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive testing to ensure all components work together
- Performance benchmarking to validate improvements
- System integration testing with realistic workloads

## Files Modified

This sprint will modify dependency management across:
- All component `requirements.txt` files (23+ files)
- Creation of `/shared/requirements/` centralized dependency management
- Component setup and installation scripts
- Documentation for dependency management practices

## Critical Dependencies to Standardize

### Web Framework Stack
- `fastapi>=0.105.0,<1.0.0`
- `uvicorn>=0.24.0,<1.0.0`
- `pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0.0`
- `websockets>=11.0.0,<12.0.0`

### LLM Integration Stack
- `anthropic>=0.10.0,<1.0.0`
- `openai>=1.1.0,<2.0.0`
- `tiktoken>=0.4.0,<1.0.0`

### Vector Processing Stack (Consolidated)
- `faiss-cpu>=1.7.4,<2.0.0`
- `sentence-transformers>=2.2.2,<3.0.0`
- `torch>=1.10.0,<2.0.0`

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- **System Stability**: Elimination of version conflict crashes
- **Faster Development**: Consistent dependency versions across components
- **Reduced Disk Usage**: 60-70% reduction in total dependency footprint

### Long-term Benefits
- **Easier Maintenance**: Centralized dependency management
- **Predictable Upgrades**: Clear version constraints and compatibility matrices
- **Better Performance**: Optimized dependency loading and reduced memory usage

### Architectural Improvements
- **Modular Dependencies**: Optional heavy dependencies with graceful degradation
- **Clear Separation**: Production vs development dependency boundaries
- **Sustainable Growth**: Scalable patterns for adding new components

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Critical conflict resolution (1 session)
- **Phase 2**: Dependency consolidation (2 sessions)
- **Phase 3**: Architecture optimization (1-2 sessions)
- **Phase 4**: Testing and validation (1 session)

Total estimated effort: 5-6 Claude Code sessions

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental Changes**: Phase-based implementation to minimize risk
- **Backup Strategy**: Comprehensive testing before major changes
- **Rollback Plan**: Clear documentation of changes for easy reversal if needed
