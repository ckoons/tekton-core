# GitHub Support Sprint - Kickoff Instructions

## Overview

These instructions will help you kick off the GitHub Support Development Sprint on April 30, 2025.

## Steps to Start the Sprint

1. **Create a Branch for the Sprint**

   ```bash
   # Ensure you're on the main branch and up to date
   git checkout main
   git pull
   
   # Create the sprint branch with tomorrow's date (April 30, 2025)
   git checkout -b sprint/github-support-250430
   
   # Push the branch to remote
   git push -u origin sprint/github-support-250430
   ```

2. **Verify the Branch**

   ```bash
   # Verify you're on the correct branch
   git branch --show-current
   ```

   This should output: `sprint/github-support-250430`

3. **Start a Claude Code Session**

   Start a new Claude Code session and provide the prompt from:
   `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/GitHub_Support_Sprint/ClaudeCodePrompt.md`

   The prompt has been updated with the correct branch name for April 30, 2025.

4. **Monitor Progress**

   Claude will:
   - Verify it's on the correct branch
   - Implement the directory structure and core utilities
   - Create the branch management scripts
   - Document all components
   - Provide a status report when done

## What to Expect

- The Claude session will implement Phase 1 of the GitHub Support Sprint
- This includes setting up the directory structure, core utility libraries, and initial branch management scripts
- Upon completion, Claude will create a status report in the StatusReports directory

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Review the implemented code and documentation
2. Check the status report for any challenges or recommendations
3. Provide feedback to Claude
4. Decide on timing for Phase 2 implementation
