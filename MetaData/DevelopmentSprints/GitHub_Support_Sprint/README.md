# GitHub Support Sprint

## Overview

This document provides guidance for the GitHub Support Development Sprint. This sprint focuses on creating tools, utilities, and documentation to enhance Tekton's integration with GitHub, particularly for managing branches across multiple components during Development Sprints.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint aims to improve the developer experience by streamlining GitHub-related workflows.

## Sprint Context

The Tekton project uses a Development Sprint process that requires working in isolated branches across multiple components. Currently, there are no standardized tools or utilities for managing these branches, which can lead to inconsistencies and challenges when working across components.

This sprint will create the necessary utilities and documentation to ensure that:

1. Development Sprint branches can be created consistently across all Tekton components
2. Claude sessions can verify they are working on the correct branches
3. Branch management follows a standardized workflow
4. Commit messages and PR descriptions follow consistent formats
5. Documentation accurately reflects the GitHub workflow

## Key Documents

This sprint directory contains the following key documents:

1. **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and guidance
2. **SprintPlan.md**: High-level overview of the sprint goals, approach, and timeline
3. **ArchitecturalDecisions.md**: Documentation of key architectural decisions
4. **ImplementationPlan.md**: Detailed plan with specific tasks and phases
5. **ClaudeCodePrompt.md**: Initial prompt for the Working Claude session

## Implementation Approach

The implementation will follow the detailed plan in the Implementation Plan document. At a high level, the approach involves:

1. Creating a set of bash utilities for branch management
2. Implementing verification tools for Claude sessions
3. Documenting the GitHub workflow for Development Sprints
4. Creating templates for commit messages and PR descriptions
5. Updating the Development Sprint process documentation to incorporate GitHub best practices

## Expected Outcomes

Upon completion of this sprint, we expect to have:

1. A comprehensive set of utilities for managing branches across Tekton components
2. Clear documentation for branch management workflows
3. Improved Development Sprint process documentation
4. Templates for GitHub-related artifacts
5. Tools for Claude sessions to verify and manage branches

## Next Steps

After reviewing this document, please proceed to:

1. Review the Sprint Plan for a high-level overview
2. Examine the Architectural Decisions to understand key design choices
3. Study the Implementation Plan for detailed tasks and phases
4. Refer to the Claude Code Prompt for specific implementation instructions
