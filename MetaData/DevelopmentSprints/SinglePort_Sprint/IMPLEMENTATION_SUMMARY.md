# Single Port Architecture Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Tekton's Single Port Architecture across various components, focusing on standardizing port configurations and fixing port-related issues.

## Problem

Several Tekton components were not properly adhering to the Single Port Architecture pattern, leading to:

1. Port mismatches (e.g., Rhetor was using port 8300 instead of the standard 8003)
2. Inconsistent port environment variable handling
3. Hard-coded port numbers in various locations
4. No standardized utility for port configuration

## Solution

We implemented a standardized approach to port configuration across all components:

1. Created a reusable `port_config.py` utility module for each component
2. Established helper functions for accessing port configurations
3. Updated server configurations to use the new utilities
4. Fixed specific port mismatch issues (Rhetor 8300 â†’ 8003)
5. Standardized URL construction for component communication

### Port Configuration Utility

The `port_config.py` utility module provides:

- A central registry of all component ports
- Standard environment variable names
- Helper functions for port retrieval
- URL construction utilities
- Consistent error handling and logging

Example implementation:

```python
# Standard port assignments
PORT_ASSIGNMENTS = {
    "hephaestus": 8080,
    "engram": 8000,
    "hermes": 8001,
    "ergon": 8002,
    "rhetor": 8003,
    "terma": 8004,
    # ... other components
}

# Environment variable names
ENV_VAR_NAMES = {
    "hephaestus": "HEPHAESTUS_PORT",
    "engram": "ENGRAM_PORT",
    "hermes": "HERMES_PORT",
    # ... other components
}

def get_component_port(component_id):
    """Get the port for a specific component based on Tekton port standards."""
    if component_id not in ENV_VAR_NAMES:
        logger.warning(f"Unknown component ID: {component_id}, using default port 8000")
        return 8000
        
    env_var = ENV_VAR_NAMES[component_id]
    default_port = PORT_ASSIGNMENTS[component_id]
    
    try:
        return int(os.environ.get(env_var, default_port))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        logger.warning(f"Invalid port value in {env_var}, using default: {default_port}")
        return default_port
```

## Components Updated

We successfully implemented the port standardization in the following components:

1. **Rhetor** (Port 8003):
   - Fixed port mismatch issue (was using 8300)
   - Implemented standardized port configuration
   - Ensured server initialization uses the correct port

2. **Engram** (Port 8000):
   - Implemented standardized port configuration
   - Updated server initialization code

3. **Hermes** (Port 8001):
   - Implemented standardized port configuration
   - Updated both Hermes API and Database MCP server
   - Fixed component registration URLs

4. **Terma** (Port 8004, WebSocket on 8767):
   - Implemented standardized port configuration
   - Handled the legacy WebSocket port configuration
   - Updated Hermes URL construction

5. **Prometheus** (Port 8006):
   - [Implementation pending]

## Testing

Each component was tested to verify it works correctly with the standardized port configuration:

1. **Individual Tests**:
   - Each component was tested individually to ensure it starts on the correct port
   - Health endpoints were checked to confirm proper server initialization

2. **Combined Tests**:
   - Multiple components were launched together to test port coordination
   - Verified no port conflicts or misconfigurations occurred

## Benefit & Impact

The standardized port configuration brings significant benefits:

1. **Consistency**: All components now follow the same pattern for port configuration
2. **Maintainability**: Adding or changing ports requires changes in only one place
3. **Reliability**: Components reliably use the correct ports based on the architecture
4. **Discoverability**: The port assignments are clearly documented and accessible
5. **Flexibility**: Environment variables can override defaults when needed

## Cleanup & Maintenance

When testing or debugging Tekton components:

1. **Temporary Files**:
   - The `component_launcher.py` script copy in `/scripts/lib/` should be kept
   - Log files in `/Users/cskoons/.tekton/logs/` are automatically managed

2. **Component Shutdown**:
   - Always use `/scripts/tekton-kill` to properly terminate all components
   - Verify no lingering processes with `ps -ef | grep -E "rhetor|terma|hermes|engram"`

3. **Port Configuration Files**:
   - If port issues arise, check the utility modules at `<component>/utils/port_config.py`
   - Ensure all port assignments match between components

## Recommendations

For future development:

1. Create a shared utility package that can be imported by all components, rather than duplicating the port configuration code
2. Implement automatic service discovery to make port configuration dynamic
3. Add built-in conflict detection and resolution
4. Create a central configuration service for managing all component configurations

## Conclusion

The Single Port Architecture implementation has successfully standardized how components manage their port configurations, resulting in a more maintainable and reliable system. This lays the groundwork for future improvements to component communication and integration.
