# Tekton Register Script Proposal

## Overview

This document proposes the implementation of a standardized component registration utility called `tekton-register` to replace the individual `register_with_hermes.py` scripts across Tekton components. This utility would significantly reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and standardize the component registration process.

## Current State Analysis

Based on analysis of the current `register_with_hermes.py` scripts across components, we've identified:

1. **High Duplication**: Nearly identical registration code is duplicated across all components.
2. **Standardization Progress**: Newer components are trying to use shared utilities with fallbacks.
3. **Common Pattern**: All scripts follow the same general pattern of defining metadata, connecting to Hermes, registering capabilities, and maintaining the connection.
4. **Limited Variation**: The primary differences between components are:
   - Component-specific metadata and capabilities
   - Minor implementation variations in error handling
   - Different approaches to signal handling and shutdown

## Proposed Solution

### Core Utility: `tekton-register`

We propose creating a standardized CLI tool that would handle registration for all components:

```
tekton-register [--component COMPONENT_NAME] [--config PATH_TO_CONFIG]
```

Key features:

1. **Standardized Configuration**: Component-specific metadata, capabilities, and dependencies defined in YAML/JSON configuration files.
2. **Automatic Discovery**: Auto-detection of component properties when possible.
3. **Consistent Lifecycle**: Standardized signal handling and shutdown procedures.
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when Hermes is unavailable.
5. **Integration with tekton-core**: Leveraging existing utilities from tekton-core.

### Implementation Location

The `tekton-register` utility should be implemented in:

```
tekton-core/tekton/utils/registration/
```

With a CLI entrypoint at:

```
tekton-core/scripts/bin/tekton-register
```

This ensures it's part of tekton-core, aligning with the ongoing standardization efforts.

### Configuration Format

Components would define their capabilities in a standardized YAML format:

```yaml
# telos.yaml
component:
  id: "telos"
  name: "Telos Requirements System"
  version: "0.1.0"
  description: "Requirements management and traceability system"
  port: 8800

capabilities:
  - id: "requirements_management"
    name: "Requirements Management"
    description: "Create and manage project requirements"
    methods:
      - id: "create_requirement"
        name: "Create Requirement"
        description: "Create a new requirement"
        parameters:
          - name: "name"
            type: "string"
            required: true
          - name: "description"
            type: "string"
            required: true
        returns:
          type: "object"
```

## Migration Path

1. **Create the Core Utility**: Implement `tekton-register` in tekton-core.
2. **Create Configuration Files**: Generate standard configuration files for each component.
3. **Gradually Replace Scripts**: Replace individual `register_with_hermes.py` scripts with calls to `tekton-register`.
4. **Update Launch Scripts**: Modify component launch scripts to use the new utility.

## Documentation Updates

The following documentation should be updated:

1. **COMPONENT_LIFECYCLE.md**: Document the standardized registration process.
2. **SHARED_COMPONENT_UTILITIES.md**: Add details about the registration utility.
3. **Component Setup Guide**: Update with instructions for the new registration process.
4. **Migration Guide**: Create a guide for transitioning to the new utility.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation

1. Build the core `tekton-register` utility in tekton-core.
2. Create the configuration schema and validation.
3. Implement a single component as a proof of concept.

### Phase 2: Component Migration

1. Create standardized configuration files for all components.
2. Update launch scripts to use the new utility.
3. Validate registration with all components.

### Phase 3: Standardization

1. Update all documentation to reflect the new registration process.
2. Remove old `register_with_hermes.py` scripts.
3. Ensure all components use the standardized approach.

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**: ~80% reduction in registration code duplication.
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Single source of truth for registration logic.
3. **Standardized Capabilities**: Consistent definition of component capabilities.
4. **Better Discoverability**: Structured format improves service discovery.
5. **Simplified Onboarding**: Easier to understand and implement for new components.
6. **Centralized Updates**: Changes to registration logic need to be made in only one place.

## Conclusion

The proposed `tekton-register` utility aligns with Tekton's ongoing standardization efforts and will significantly reduce code duplication while improving maintainability. By centralizing the registration logic and standardizing the capability definition format, we can create a more cohesive and maintainable system.

This implementation would serve as an excellent addition to the Shared Code Sprint and would provide immediate benefits across all components.
