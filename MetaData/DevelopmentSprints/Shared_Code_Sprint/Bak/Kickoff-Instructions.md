# Tekton Register Implementation - Kickoff Instructions

## Overview

This document provides kickoff instructions for implementing the `tekton-register` utility across all Tekton components. The goal is to replace all individual `register_with_hermes.py` scripts with a standardized, shared implementation.

## Session Setup

To start a new Claude Code session for this implementation:

1. **Start a new Claude Code session**
2. **Provide the `ClaudeCodePrompt-Updated.md` as the initial prompt**
3. **Share the `Tekton-Register-Implementation-Plan.md` file if needed for further reference**

## Implementation Scope

The implementation focuses exclusively on creating a standardized component registration system:

1. **Core Utility**: Create the `tekton-register` utility in tekton-core
2. **Component Migration**: Convert all components to use the new utility
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation to reflect the new approach

## Branch Management

Create and use a dedicated branch for this implementation:

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton
git checkout -b shared-code/tekton-register
```

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be successful when:

1. The `tekton-register` utility is fully implemented and working
2. All components have been migrated to use the new utility
3. All individual `register_with_hermes.py` scripts have been removed
4. Documentation has been updated to reflect the new approach
5. All tests pass successfully

## Developer Notes

- The implementation should prioritize correctness and robustness over performance
- The utility should handle error cases gracefully
- All code should follow Tekton's style guidelines and include comprehensive docstrings

## Testing Guidelines

For each migrated component, verify:

1. The component registers successfully with Hermes
2. The registration includes all capabilities correctly
3. The component unregisters properly on shutdown
4. The component handles connection errors appropriately

## Post-Implementation Tasks

After completing the implementation:

1. Request a code review
2. Address any feedback from the review
3. Prepare to merge the changes into the main branch
4. Plan for announcing the changes to the Tekton development team

## Questions or Issues

If you encounter any questions or issues during implementation, please document them clearly with:

1. The specific problem encountered
2. Any error messages or logs
3. Potential approaches to resolving the issue
