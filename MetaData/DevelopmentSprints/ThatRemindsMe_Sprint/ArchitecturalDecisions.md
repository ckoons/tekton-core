# Architectural Decisions - ThatRemindsMe Sprint

## Overview
This document outlines key architectural decisions for implementing persona-based AI instantiation with progressive memory loading. These decisions balance innovation with practical implementation.

## Decision 1: Persona Identity Storage

### Context
AI personas need persistent identity that survives across sessions while remaining flexible enough to grow and adapt.

### Decision
Store persona manifests in Engram using a structured format that captures core identity, traits, accumulated wisdom, and relationship context.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Simple Name-Value Pairs**: Basic identity storage
   - Pros: Simple implementation
   - Cons: Lacks richness needed for personality

2. **Full Memory Dump**: Store entire conversation history
   - Pros: Complete context
   - Cons: Context window overflow, slow loading

3. **Structured Manifests**: Hierarchical identity representation
   - Pros: Rich representation, selective loading
   - Cons: More complex schema

### Implications
- Need versioning for persona evolution
- Schema must be extensible
- Storage in Engram's structured memory system
- Export/import capabilities for persona sharing

## Decision 2: Progressive Memory Architecture

### Context
Loading all memories floods context window and reduces available space for current task.

### Decision
Implement lazy-loading memory system where AI can request memories based on relevance and need.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Preload Everything**: Load all memories upfront
   - Pros: Everything available immediately
   - Cons: Context window overflow

2. **Fixed Subset**: Load predetermined memory set
   - Pros: Predictable context usage
   - Cons: May miss relevant memories

3. **On-Demand Retrieval**: AI requests memories as needed
   - Pros: Efficient context use, relevant loading
   - Cons: Requires sophisticated retrieval

### Implications
- MCP tools for memory search and retrieval
- Relevance scoring algorithms
- Caching for frequently accessed memories
- Clear feedback when memories are loaded

## Decision 3: Memory Retrieval Interface

### Context
AI needs intuitive ways to access memories without complex query languages.

### Decision
Natural language memory retrieval with semantic search capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Structured Queries**: SQL-like memory access
   - Pros: Precise control
   - Cons: Unnatural for AI interaction

2. **Keyword Search**: Simple text matching
   - Pros: Easy to implement
   - Cons: Misses semantic relationships

3. **Natural Language**: "Show me memories about..."
   - Pros: Intuitive, semantic understanding
   - Cons: Requires NLP processing

### Implications
- Semantic embedding for memory search
- Natural language processing for queries
- Relevance ranking algorithms
- Memory categorization and tagging

## Decision 4: Persona Instantiation Process

### Context
Need seamless way to "hire" personas for specific tasks from command line.

### Decision
Extend Terma launcher with persona loading capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Separate Tool**: Dedicated persona launcher
   - Pros: Focused functionality
   - Cons: Additional complexity

2. **Manual Loading**: Copy-paste persona context
   - Pros: Simple, no new code
   - Cons: Error-prone, poor UX

3. **Integrated Launch**: Built into Terma
   - Pros: Seamless experience, single entry point
   - Cons: Terma complexity increase

### Implications
- Terma CLI modifications
- Persona validation on load
- Task context integration
- Error handling for missing personas

## Decision 5: Identity Continuity Model

### Context
Personas must maintain consistent identity while allowing growth and change.

### Decision
Core identity anchors with flexible trait evolution.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Fixed Identity**: Never-changing personas
   - Pros: Perfectly consistent
   - Cons: Cannot learn or adapt

2. **Completely Fluid**: No fixed elements
   - Pros: Maximum adaptability
   - Cons: Loss of identity coherence

3. **Anchored Evolution**: Core + growth
   - Pros: Stable identity with learning
   - Cons: Complex balance required

### Implications
- Core identity elements are immutable
- Traits and knowledge can evolve
- Versioning for persona evolution
- Clear distinction between core and learned

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance
- Memory retrieval must be fast (<1s)
- Incremental context loading
- Efficient similarity search
- Caching strategies

### Privacy and Security
- Persona data isolation
- Access control for personas
- Sensitive memory handling
- Export restrictions

### Scalability
- Support multiple personas
- Efficient storage as memories grow
- Retrieval performance at scale
- Archival strategies

### User Experience
- Intuitive CLI interface
- Clear feedback on memory loading
- Persona status visibility
- Task assignment confirmation

## Future Considerations
- Persona collaboration capabilities
- Memory sharing between personas
- Persona templates and archetypes
- Integration with other Tekton components
- Automated persona trait evolution

## Notes for Implementation
The implementing Claude should consider how to make the memory retrieval feel natural and the persona loading seamless. The key is balancing sophistication with usability.
