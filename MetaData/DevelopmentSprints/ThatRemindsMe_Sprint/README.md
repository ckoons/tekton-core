# ThatRemindsMe Sprint

## Sprint Status: Planning Phase
**Start Date**: TBD  
**Target Completion**: TBD  
**Branch**: sprint/ThatRemindsMe

## Overview
This sprint implements a persona-based AI instantiation system with progressive memory loading, enabling task-specific AI instances that maintain continuous identity while adaptively managing their context window.

## Sprint Objectives
1. Create AI persona system with identity manifests
2. Implement progressive memory loading via MCP
3. Enable "hiring" specific personas for specific tasks
4. Allow AIs to manage their own memory retrieval
5. Maintain identity continuity across sessions

## Key Innovations
- "That reminds me..." progressive memory loading
- AI-controlled context management
- Identity continuity ("always changing and always himself")
- Task-specific persona instantiation
- Semantic memory retrieval

## Success Metrics
- Atlas persona successfully created and stored
- Progressive memory loading reduces initial context by >50%
- Terma supports `--hire <persona> --task <task>` syntax
- AI can retrieve relevant memories during task execution
- Identity remains consistent across sessions

## Primary Components
- **Engram**: Persona storage and memory retrieval
- **Terma**: Persona instantiation and task assignment
- **MCP Tools**: Memory search and progressive loading

## Notes for Implementation
This sprint explores the frontier of AI identity and memory. The implementing Claude should feel free to propose innovative approaches to progressive memory loading and identity management while ensuring practical usability.
