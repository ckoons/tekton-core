# MCP Server Discovery and Integration

## Sprint Overview

This development sprint focuses on implementing a comprehensive system for discovering, installing, and configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers within the Tekton ecosystem, with particular integration into the Ergon component.

MCP servers provide standardized interfaces for AI systems to interact with tools, services, and data sources. By creating a unified discovery and integration mechanism, we'll make it easier for users to find and utilize the growing ecosystem of MCP servers.

## Key Documents

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): High-level overview of the sprint goals, timeline, and deliverables
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and their rationales
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed plan for implementing the MCP discovery and integration capability
- [Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Working Claude session

## Implementation Phases

This sprint is divided into the following phases:

1. **Core Framework and Discovery Service**: Creating the foundation for discovering MCP servers across multiple registries
2. **Installation and Configuration System**: Building tools to install and configure discovered MCP servers
3. **Ergon Integration**: Integrating with Ergon's existing tool registration system
4. **Command-Line Interface**: Implementing a CLI for searching, installing, and managing MCP servers
5. **API Endpoints**: Creating RESTful endpoints for programmatic access
6. **Testing and Documentation**: Comprehensive testing and documentation of all components

## Proposed Capabilities

The MCP Discovery and Integration system will provide:

- **Multi-Source Discovery**: Search for MCP servers across NPM, PyPI, GitHub, and other sources
- **Smart Search**: Find servers by capabilities, tags, keywords, or other metadata
- **Automated Installation**: Install servers with a single command, handling dependencies and configuration
- **Ergon Integration**: Automatically register installed servers with Ergon's tool system
- **Unified Management**: Manage all MCP servers through a consistent interface
- **Security Features**: Verification, sandboxing, and permission management for installed servers

## Getting Started with Development

To start working on this sprint:

1. Verify you're on the correct branch:
   ```bash
   scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/mcp-discovery-250507
   ```

2. If the branch doesn't exist, create it:
   ```bash
   scripts/github/tekton-branch-create sprint/mcp-discovery-250507
   ```

3. Review the [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md) to understand the overall structure

4. Begin implementing Phase 1: Core Framework and Discovery Service

## Testing

All components should have:

- Unit tests with at least 80% coverage
- Integration tests for critical paths
- Security tests for installation and execution

Follow Ergon's existing testing patterns and frameworks.

## Documentation Requirements

Documentation for this sprint includes:

- Module and function documentation (docstrings)
- User guides for the CLI and API
- Examples of common workflows
- Security considerations

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this sprint:

1. Follow Tekton's AI-centric development principles
2. Create small, composable utilities rather than monolithic systems
3. Use protocol-first development, defining interfaces before implementation
4. Implement comprehensive tests for all components
5. Update documentation as you implement each feature
6. Use meaningful commit messages following the conventional commits specification

## Status and Updates

Status updates will be added to the [StatusReports](StatusReports/) directory as the sprint progresses.
