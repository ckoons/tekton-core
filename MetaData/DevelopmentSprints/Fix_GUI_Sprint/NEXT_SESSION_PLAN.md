# Next Claude Code Session Plan - Standardizing Component UIs

## Session Focus: Standardizing Ergon Component

This document outlines the plan for our next Claude Code session, which will focus on updating the Ergon component to use the same standardized UI structure we successfully implemented for the Athena component.

## Objectives

1. **Update Ergon Component Structure**
   - Revise the Ergon component to use the standardized 4-part layout:
     1. Header with hexagon icon and title (respecting SHOW_GREEK_NAMES)
     2. Menu bar with tabs for different functionality
     3. Content area with proper scrolling behavior
     4. Footer with chat input area (consistent with Athena)

2. **Apply Consistent Styling**
   - Use consistent class naming conventions
   - Apply the same styling patterns for headers, tabs, and input areas
   - Use the Ergon-specific color scheme (#0097A7 Teal) consistently

3. **Create Reusable Component Template**
   - Extract common patterns from both components
   - Document the standardized approach for future components
   - Create a reference implementation that can be used for all remaining components

## Working Approach

To ensure an efficient and collaborative session, we will follow this working approach:

1. **Methodical Review and Approval Process**
   - Claude will present proposals for changes before making them
   - All changes will be reviewed and approved before implementation
   - Small, incremental changes will be preferred over large rewrites
   - Changes will be tested after each significant modification

2. **No Surprise Changes**
   - Claude will not modify files without explicit approval
   - All significant design decisions will be discussed first
   - Any challenges or issues will be highlighted for collaborative resolution

3. **Focused Implementation**
   - We will focus on one component at a time
   - Each part of the standardized structure will be addressed in sequence
   - We will verify each change works correctly before moving to the next

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of the session, we expect to have:

1. An updated Ergon component that uses the standardized UI structure
2. Documentation of the component structure pattern for reference
3. A clear path for updating the remaining components
4. Improved consistency across the Tekton interface

## Future Sessions

After standardizing the Ergon component, subsequent sessions will:

1. Update the Hermes component to use the standardized structure
2. Continue with remaining components in priority order
3. Implement any additional shared utilities needed
4. Create comprehensive documentation for the standardized UI approach

This structured approach will ensure that all Tekton components provide a consistent user experience while maintaining their unique functionality.
