# Fix GUI Sprint - Sprint Plan (Updated May 10, 2025)

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level plan for the Fix GUI Sprint Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes, with recent updates reflecting discovered infrastructure issues.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on simplifying and standardizing the Hephaestus UI architecture to create a more reliable component integration system.

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Goals
1. ‚úÖ Fix the Athena component integration with Hephaestus UI
2. ‚úÖ Simplify the Hephaestus UI architecture for more reliable component rendering
3. ‚úÖ Standardize the component loading and rendering process
4. ‚úÖ Create a consistent UI panel layout with left navigation and right content
5. ‚úÖ Add AI/LLM chat interfaces to all component screens

### Secondary Goals
1. ‚úÖ Reduce Shadow DOM complexity where possible
2. ‚úÖ Improve WebSocket connection handling
3. ‚úÖ Create documentation for component development
4. ‚úÖ Establish clear UI architecture patterns

## Implementation Approach - STATUS UPDATE ‚ö†Ô∏è

We've implemented a pragmatic approach that focuses on component functionality, but have identified significant infrastructure issues:

### Phase 1: Core UI Architecture (PARTIALLY COMPLETE ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Fixed WebSocket connection handling with proper RFC-compliant protocol
- ‚úÖ Refactored UI panel system with clear navigation and content areas
- ‚úÖ Modified UI Manager to correctly load components in their designated panels
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper server socket reuse for reliability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEW ISSUE**: Identified path conflicts with component loading mechanism
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEW ISSUE**: Multiple component-loader.js implementations causing conflicts

### Phase 2: Component Implementation (MIXED RESULTS ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Created standardized component architecture using ES6 classes
- ‚úÖ Implemented Direct HTML Injection pattern for component rendering
- ‚úÖ UI for Athena component working with full functionality
- ‚úÖ UI for Ergon component working with BEM styling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Component extraction encountering path and loader conflicts
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Hermes component implementation PAUSED (was 40% complete)
- ‚¨ú Remaining components ON HOLD until infrastructure issues resolved

### Phase 3: Shared Utilities and Integration (INFRASTRUCTURE CONFLICTS ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Created standardized tab navigation system
- ‚úÖ Implemented reusable chat interface components
- ‚úÖ Added team chat functionality across components
- ‚úÖ Connected components to Tekton LLM Adapter through WebSocket
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Integration issues between new utilities and existing code
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Path conflicts with shared utility files

## Component Implementation Progress (UPDATED MAY 10)

## Technical Implementation Highlights

1. **Class-Based Component Pattern**:
```javascript
class ComponentName {
  constructor() {
    this.state = {
      initialized: false,
      activeTab: 'default'
    };
  }
  
  init() {
    // Initialize component
    this.loadComponentHTML();
    this.setupEventListeners();
    this.state.initialized = true;
    return this;
  }
  
  // Component-specific methods...
}

// Create global instance
window.componentName = new ComponentName();
```

2. **BEM CSS Naming Convention**:
```css
/* Block */
.component-name { }

/* Elements */
.component-name__header { }
.component-name__tab { }
.component-name__button { }

/* Modifiers */
.component-name__tab--active { }
.component-name__button--primary { }
```

3. **Standardized Panel Structure**:
   - **Header**: Fixed at the top with component title and controls
   - **Menu/Tabs**: Navigation tabs below the header
   - **Work Area**: Main content between menu and footer
   - **Footer/Chat Input Area**: Fixed at the bottom for chat panels

## Technical Debt Resolution

We've addressed several key areas of technical debt:

| Issue | Severity | Status | Resolution |
|-------|:--------:|:------:|------------|
| **WebSocket Connection** | High | ‚úÖ | Implemented RFC-compliant protocol with proper handshake and frame handling |
| **Shadow DOM Conflicts** | High | ‚úÖ | Replaced with Direct HTML Injection pattern |
| **Component Loading** | High | ‚úÖ | Implemented standardized loading with proper error handling |
| **UI Manager File Size** | High | ‚úÖ | Created modular structure with component-specific files |
| **Chat Input Positioning** | Medium | ‚úÖ | Fixed with proper CSS for sticky positioning |
| **Server Restart Reliability** | Medium | ‚úÖ | Added proper socket cleanup and address reuse flags |
| **Inconsistent Component Styling** | Medium | ‚úÖ | Implemented BEM naming and standardized CSS structure |

## Current Sprint Focus (Updated May 10, 2025) - REVISED ‚ö†Ô∏è

Due to discovered infrastructure issues, our immediate focus has changed:

1. **HIGHEST PRIORITY: Resolve Infrastructure Issues**:
   - Decide on a standard directory structure for component files
     - Option A: Flat structure `/scripts/component-name-component.js`
     - Option B: Nested structure `/scripts/components/component-name/component-name-component.js`
   - Resolve component loader conflicts
     - Determine which component-loader.js to use as the standard
     - Update all component references to use the standardized loader
   - Test path resolution with existing components
     - Verify Athena and Ergon components work with the standardized approach
     - Document the standard paths for future development

2. **PAUSED: Hermes Component Implementation**:
   - Implementation paused until infrastructure issues are resolved
   - Will resume once path structure and loader conflicts are fixed
   - Current implementation (40% complete) to be updated with standardized approach

3. **REVISED: Utility Integration**:
   - Identify and fix conflicts between new utilities and existing code
   - Create clear guidelines for utility usage in components
   - Establish standard imports and access patterns

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Document the infrastructure issues and solutions
   - Update component implementation templates to reflect the standardized approach
   - Create clear guidelines for future component development

## Revised Next Steps

1. **Resolve infrastructure issues** (path conflicts, component loader)
2. **Fix existing component extraction** (Athena, Ergon)
3. **Resume Hermes component implementation** with standardized approach
4. **Continue implementing remaining components** following our roadmap ONLY after infrastructure stabilized:
   - Engram
   - Rhetor
   - Prometheus
   - (etc.)

5. **Create comprehensive test suite** to verify component loading works reliably
6. **Document the standardized approach** for future development

## Conclusion - UPDATED MAY 10, 2025

The Fix GUI Sprint has made progress in addressing the Hephaestus UI architecture issues, with mixed results. The user interface components (Athena and Ergon) are working correctly and demonstrate the viability of our class-based component approach. However, infrastructure issues related to path structure and component loading mechanisms have emerged as significant challenges.

We have identified several critical conflicts that must be resolved before continuing with additional component development:
1. Path structure conflicts between different directory organizations
2. Multiple competing component loader implementations 
3. Integration issues between new utilities and existing code

Our revised plan prioritizes resolving these infrastructure issues before proceeding with additional component development. By establishing a standardized approach to component structure, loading, and path management, we can build a more maintainable foundation for the remaining components.

The GUI sprint will focus on resolving these infrastructure challenges first, then resume implementation of the remaining components using the standardized approach. This tactical shift will ensure we deliver a more robust and maintainable UI system for Tekton in the long term.
