# Fix GUI Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level plan for the Fix GUI Sprint Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on simplifying and standardizing the Hephaestus UI architecture to create a more reliable component integration system.

## Sprint Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Fix the Athena component integration with Hephaestus UI
2. Simplify the Hephaestus UI architecture for more reliable component rendering
3. Standardize the component loading and rendering process
4. Create a consistent UI panel layout with left navigation and right content
5. Add AI/LLM chat interfaces to all component screens

### Secondary Goals
1. Reduce Shadow DOM complexity where possible
2. Improve WebSocket connection handling
3. Create documentation for component development
4. Establish clear UI architecture patterns

## Approach

This sprint will follow a three-phase approach:

### Phase 1: UI Architecture Simplification
- Refactor UI panel system to clearly differentiate navigation and content areas
- Fix WebSocket connection handling with proper HTTP/WS separation
- Modify UI Manager to correctly load components in their designated panels

### Phase 2: Component Standardization
- Create standardized component templates for HTML and JavaScript
- Establish consistent component registration patterns
- Fix Athena component integration using the new architecture
- Test with multiple components to ensure reliability

### Phase 3: Chat Interface Integration
- Add standardized chat interface to component screens
- Ensure Terma terminal functionality works correctly
- Connect chat interfaces to Tekton LLM Adapter

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 3 days | Refactored UI Manager, Fixed WebSocket handling, Panel layout improvements |
| Phase 2 | 4 days | Component templates, Athena integration, Multi-component testing |
| Phase 3 | 3 days | Chat interface components, Terma integration, LLM connection |

## Success Criteria

1. Athena component loads and functions correctly in Hephaestus UI
2. Components reliably render in the correct panel locations
3. WebSocket connections establish without errors
4. UI architecture is documented and follows clear patterns
5. Chat interfaces are available and functional on component screens

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Complex DOM manipulation may cause unexpected behavior | Simplify DOM structure, use clear separation of concerns |
| WebSocket connection issues persist | Implement clear separation of HTTP and WS handlers |
| Component loading remains unreliable | Create standardized testing process for components |
| Shadow DOM isolation causes style conflicts | Minimize Shadow DOM usage or establish clear style isolation |

## Resources Required

1. Access to Hephaestus UI codebase
2. Testing environment for UI components
3. Existing component templates (especially Terma)
4. Documentation on Tekton LLM Adapter integration

## Dependencies

1. Tekton LLM Adapter for chat interface integration
2. Terma component for terminal functionality
3. Existing component registry structure
4. Hephaestus server configuration
