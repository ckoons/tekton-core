# Fix GUI Sprint

## Overview

This Development Sprint focuses on simplifying and standardizing the Hephaestus UI architecture to create a more reliable component integration system. We're implementing a Direct HTML Injection approach to solve issues with component loading and UI rendering.

## Key Documents

- **[ClaudeCodePrompt.md](./ClaudeCodePrompt.md)**: The revised prompt for Claude Code sessions detailing our approach
- **[ImplementationPlan.md](./ImplementationPlan.md)**: Detailed implementation plan with tasks and acceptance criteria
- **[COMPONENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md](./COMPONENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)**: Track progress of each component migration
- **[COMPONENT_LOADER_TEMPLATE.md](./COMPONENT_LOADER_TEMPLATE.md)**: Template for implementing direct HTML injection for components

## Current Status

We have successfully:

1. **Established a Direct HTML Injection Pattern**:
   - Implemented a new approach in `ui-manager.js` that injects component HTML directly into the page
   - Created a template pattern for all components to follow
   - Fixed Athena component as the first test case

2. **Fixed WebSocket Connection Issues**:
   - Implemented proper WebSocket protocol handling in `server.py`
   - Updated WebSocket client to use the Single Port Architecture pattern
   - Added proper error handling and protocol conformance

3. **Created Documentation**:
   - Component Loader Template with detailed implementation guide
   - Progress tracking for each component
   - Component analysis methodology

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation differs from the original plan by using **Direct HTML Injection** instead of loading external HTML files or using Shadow DOM. This approach:

1. **Eliminates Document Structure Issues**: Previous approach was loading complete HTML documents with DOCTYPE, html, head tags, which browsers interpret as full page replacements

2. **Simplifies Debugging**: All component HTML is visible directly in the page DOM, making it easier to inspect and debug

3. **Reduces Dependencies**: Components work without requiring complex Shadow DOM encapsulation or external HTML files

4. **Improves Maintainability**: Component structure is clearly defined in the code, making it easier to understand and modify

## Next Steps

Following our component-by-component approach, the next steps are:

1. **Analyze Ergon Component**:
   - Document tab structure and required functionality
   - Create migration plan
   - Get approval for implementation approach

2. **Implement Ergon Component**:
   - Create dedicated loader function in ui-manager.js
   - Extract HTML content and implement tab functionality
   - Test and refine

3. **Continue with Other Components**:
   - Follow the same analysis and implementation pattern for each component
   - Create shared utilities for common functionality as needed
   - Implement chat interface integration

## Usage Instructions

To continue work on this sprint:

1. **Read Key Documents**: Start with the revised ClaudeCodePrompt.md and ImplementationPlan.md

2. **Check Component Progress**: Review COMPONENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md to see what's been completed and what's next

3. **Use the Component Loader Template**: When implementing a new component, use COMPONENT_LOADER_TEMPLATE.md as a guide

4. **Test Incrementally**: After each component implementation, test thoroughly before moving to the next one

## Implementation Notes

### Direct HTML Injection Pattern

The Direct HTML Injection pattern involves:

1. Creating a dedicated loader function for each component
2. Generating HTML content directly in JavaScript
3. Injecting this content into the HTML panel
4. Setting up event handlers and initialization

Example structure:

```javascript
load[Component]Component() {
    // Set active component
    this.activeComponent = '[component-id]';
    
    // Get and clear HTML panel
    const htmlPanel = document.getElementById('html-panel');
    htmlPanel.innerHTML = '';
    
    // Activate HTML panel
    this.activatePanel('html');
    
    // Define component HTML
    const componentHtml = `
        <div id="[component-id]-container" class="[component-id]-component">
            <\!-- Component HTML structure -->
        </div>
    `;
    
    // Add HTML to panel
    htmlPanel.innerHTML = componentHtml;
    
    // Set up event handling
    this.setup[Component]Events();
    
    // Register component
    this.components['[component-id]'] = {
        id: '[component-id]',
        loaded: true,
        usesTerminal: false,
        container: document.getElementById('[component-id]-container')
    };
}
```

### WebSocket Connection in Single Port Architecture

The Single Port Architecture uses the same port for both HTTP and WebSocket connections but with different URL paths:

- HTTP: Standard paths like `/`, `/api/*`, etc.
- WebSocket: `/ws` path

This approach simplifies deployment and connection management while maintaining clear separation between protocols.
