# Launch Testing & Port Standardization Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation work done during the Launch Testing Sprint, which focused on improving the reliability of Tekton component launches and standardizing port configuration.

## Overview

The sprint addressed several critical issues that were preventing Tekton components from launching reliably. It also implemented the Single Port Architecture pattern across multiple components to standardize port configuration.

## Achievements

### 1. Fixed Critical Launch Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Claude Process Termination | Modified `tekton-kill` to exclude Claude/Anthropic processes |
| Missing Async Methods | Added missing async implementations in Hermes MessageBus |
| Component Directory Variable | Created standalone launcher script to properly handle paths |
| Rhetor PromptTemplateRegistry | Added missing `load_from_directory` method via monkey patch |
| Port Mismatch Issues | Standardized port configuration across multiple components |

### 2. Port Standardization

We implemented the Single Port Architecture pattern across multiple components:

- **Rhetor** (8003): Fixed port mismatch (was using 8300)
- **Terma** (8004): Standardized configuration, handled legacy WebSocket port
- **Engram** (8000): Standardized configuration for memory services
- **Hermes** (8001): Standardized configuration and updated registration URLs
- **Prometheus** (8006): Prepared for future implementation
- **Harmonia** (8007): Implemented standardized port configuration and health check
- **Telos** (8008): Added port configuration utilities and updated Prometheus connector

The implementation involved:
- Creating a standardized `port_config.py` utility module for each component
- Implementing helper functions for port retrieval and URL construction
- Updating server initialization code to use the standardized configuration
- Ensuring consistent environment variable naming across components

### 3. Launch Script Improvements

- **tekton-kill**: Enhanced to safely exclude Claude/Anthropic processes
- **Component Launcher**: Created a standalone Python script to replace string interpolation
- **Launch Process**: Improved process handling and error reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Component Launcher Script

Created a standalone Python script (`component_launcher.py`) to handle component launches:

```python
async def launch_with_start_server(module_path, component_dir, host, port, log_file):
    """Launch a component that has a start_server function."""
    # Set up Python path
    sys.path.insert(0, component_dir)
    
    try:
        # Import the module
        module_name = module_path
        logger.info(f"Importing module {module_name}")
        module = importlib.import_module(module_name)
        
        # Check if the module has a start_server function
        if hasattr(module, 'start_server'):
            logger.info(f"Starting server with {module_name}.start_server({host}, {port})")
            await module.start_server(host=host, port=port)
        else:
            logger.error(f"Module {module_name} does not have a start_server function")
            return 1
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error starting server: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()
        return 1
    
    return 0
```

### Port Configuration Utility

Created a standardized port configuration utility for each component:

```python
# Standard port assignments
PORT_ASSIGNMENTS = {
    "hephaestus": 8080,
    "engram": 8000,
    "hermes": 8001,
    "ergon": 8002,
    "rhetor": 8003,
    "terma": 8004,
    "athena": 8005,
    "prometheus": 8006,
    "harmonia": 8007,
    "telos": 8008,
    "synthesis": 8009,
    "tekton_core": 8010,
    "llm_adapter": 8300,
}

# Environment variable names
ENV_VAR_NAMES = {
    "hephaestus": "HEPHAESTUS_PORT",
    "engram": "ENGRAM_PORT",
    "hermes": "HERMES_PORT",
    "ergon": "ERGON_PORT", 
    "rhetor": "RHETOR_PORT",
    "terma": "TERMA_PORT",
    "athena": "ATHENA_PORT",
    "prometheus": "PROMETHEUS_PORT",
    "harmonia": "HARMONIA_PORT",
    "telos": "TELOS_PORT",
    "synthesis": "SYNTHESIS_PORT",
    "tekton_core": "TEKTON_CORE_PORT",
    "llm_adapter": "LLM_ADAPTER_HTTP_PORT",
}

def get_component_port(component_id):
    """Get the port for a specific component."""
    if component_id not in ENV_VAR_NAMES:
        logger.warning(f"Unknown component ID: {component_id}, using default port 8000")
        return 8000
        
    env_var = ENV_VAR_NAMES[component_id]
    default_port = PORT_ASSIGNMENTS[component_id]
    
    try:
        return int(os.environ.get(env_var, default_port))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        logger.warning(f"Invalid port value in {env_var}, using default: {default_port}")
        return default_port
```

We also added port availability checking to prevent startup failures:

```python
def check_port_availability(port: int) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Check if a port is available to use."""
    try:
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.settimeout(1)
        result = sock.connect_ex(('localhost', port))
        sock.close()
        
        if result == 0:
            # Port is in use
            return False, f"Port {port} is already in use by another application"
        else:
            # Port is available
            return True, f"Port {port} is available"
    except Exception as e:
        return False, f"Error checking port {port}: {str(e)}"
```

### Rhetor PromptTemplateRegistry Monkey Patch

Added the missing `load_from_directory` method to fix Rhetor startup issues:

```python
def load_from_directory(self, directory: str) -> int:
    """Load templates from a directory."""
    logger.info(f"Loading templates from directory: {directory}")
    count = 0
    
    if not os.path.exists(directory) or not os.path.isdir(directory):
        logger.warning(f"Directory does not exist or is not a directory: {directory}")
        return count
        
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith('.json'):
            try:
                filepath = os.path.join(directory, filename)
                with open(filepath, 'r') as f:
                    template_data = json.load(f)
                
                template_id = os.path.splitext(filename)[0]
                self.register_template(template_id, template_data)
                count += 1
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error loading template {filename}: {e}")
                
    return count
```

## Conclusion

The Launch Testing Sprint has significantly improved the reliability of Tekton component launches and standardized the port configuration across all components through the Single Port Architecture pattern. 

### Key Achievements:

1. **Standardized All Component Ports**:
   - Successfully assigned and verified all components working on their designated ports
   - Fixed port mismatches in configuration files, especially for Prometheus (8005→8006) and Synthesis (8010→8009)
   - Verified each component implements the expected endpoints on their assigned port

2. **Implemented Single Port Architecture**:
   - Updated code to use standardized port environment variables and configuration
   - Fixed health endpoints to follow a consistent format across components
   - Added proper root endpoints for component identification
   - Verified path-based routing with Hermes using `/api/*` endpoints for services
   - Confirmed all components follow Single Port Architecture with standardized endpoint paths

3. **Fixed Critical Component Issues**:
   - Added missing `__init__.py` file in Prometheus to enable detection by launch scripts
   - Fixed async method naming conflicts in Hermes message bus
   - Updated Synthesis health endpoint to follow Single Port Architecture pattern
   - Resolved import issues in LLM adapter code
   - Implemented missing `get_storage_info` method in Engram's MemoryService class
   - Fixed component ID format in Engram configuration for proper registration
   - Documented Hermes API endpoint structure, confirming endpoints are available at `/api/register` and `/api/query`

4. **Improved Reliability**:
   - Enhanced launch scripts to properly handle component initialization
   - Added proper startup and health checking mechanisms
   - Fixed issue with Claude process termination in tekton-kill script

With these improvements, Tekton components can now be launched reliably and communicate with each other through standardized URLs. This lays a solid foundation for future enhancements to the system's architecture and makes it easier to develop, deploy, and maintain Tekton components.

During this sprint, we've successfully:

1. Ensured all components launch correctly and respond to health checks
2. Fixed critical issues in component code (such as Engram's missing `get_storage_info` method)
3. Updated component configurations to follow standardized formats
4. Created documentation for properly using the Single Port Architecture endpoints
5. Established a verification process for testing component launch functionality
6. Updated the tekton-status script to identify and track MCP protocol availability
7. Documented the MCP architecture where Hermes serves as the central MCP hub with Engram having its own implementation
