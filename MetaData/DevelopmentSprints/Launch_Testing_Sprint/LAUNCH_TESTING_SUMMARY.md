# Tekton Launch Testing - Summary Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the findings from testing the launch process for Tekton components, focusing specifically on core components: Hermes, Engram, and Rhetor. The testing identified several issues that need to be addressed in the upcoming FastMCP Development Sprint.

## Component Status Summary

| Component | Status | Issues | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Hermes | ✅ Working | Missing async methods, database MCP script | Fixed with temporary workarounds |
| Engram | ✅ Working | Minor health check error | Functional with fallback mode |
| Rhetor | ❌ Error | Missing `load_from_directory` method, port mismatch | Requires code update |

## Key Findings

### 1. Hermes Component

Hermes, the central messaging and service discovery component, is now functioning correctly after fixes to the `MessageBus` class and the addition of a temporary database MCP script. The component successfully starts up and its health endpoint responds with the expected data.

Key Fixes:
- Added missing async methods (`create_channel`, `subscribe`, `publish`)
- Created a stub database MCP script
- Fixed import errors in health endpoint
- Enhanced error handling for async operations

### 2. Engram Component

Engram, the memory system, starts up successfully and provides the expected memory services. There is a minor error in the health check related to a missing method (`get_storage_info`), but this doesn't affect functionality.

Key Fixes:
- Ensured proper fallback mode configuration
- Verified integration with Hermes

### 3. Rhetor Component

Rhetor, the LLM management system, has several issues preventing successful startup:

1. **Missing Template Method**: The error `'PromptTemplateRegistry' object has no attribute 'load_from_directory'` indicates a mismatch between the expected API and the actual implementation.

2. **Port Mismatch**: The script attempts to launch Rhetor on port 8003, but logs show it was running on port 8300 in previous attempts.

3. **Launch Script Issues**: The `component_dir` variable isn't properly passed to the inner subprocess in `tekton_start_component_server`.

For Rhetor to function properly, these issues need to be addressed in the FastMCP sprint.

## Launch Script Analysis

The testing revealed several issues with the launch scripts:

1. **Bash Compatibility**: The scripts used Bash 4.x features that don't work on macOS's default Bash 3.2.

2. **Process Management**: The `tekton-kill` script could terminate Claude sessions, which has been fixed by adding an exclusion pattern.

3. **Component Detection**: The `tekton-status` script didn't correctly detect all running components, which has been fixed by enhancing the detection patterns.

4. **Error Handling**: The scripts don't provide clear error messages and don't handle startup failures gracefully.

## Recommendations for FastMCP Sprint

1. **Standardize Component Interfaces**
   - Ensure all components implement the same expected methods and interfaces
   - Fix the `PromptTemplateRegistry` in Rhetor to include `load_from_directory`
   - Standardize port configurations across all components

2. **Enhance Launch Process**
   - Improve error handling in launch scripts
   - Provide clearer error messages for startup failures
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

3. **Simplify Component Dependencies**
   - Make component dependencies explicit in documentation
   - Add automatic dependency resolution
   - Improve failure handling when dependencies are unavailable

4. **Testing and Verification**
   - Create automated tests for launching each component
   - Add health check verification after component startup
   - Implement integration tests for component communication

## Next Steps

1. Fix the identified issues in Rhetor to ensure it launches correctly
2. Test the remaining components in sequence
3. Document all findings for the FastMCP sprint

## Conclusion

The launch testing has identified several issues that need to be addressed to ensure reliable startup of Tekton components. The core infrastructure components (Hermes and Engram) are now working correctly with the implemented fixes, but Rhetor still requires attention. Once Rhetor is fixed, testing can proceed to the remaining components.
