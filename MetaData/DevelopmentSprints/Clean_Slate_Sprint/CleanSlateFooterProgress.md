# Clean Slate Footer Components Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the Budget, Profile, and Settings footer components for the Tekton Clean Slate Sprint. The implementation follows the Clean Slate architecture pattern with proper component isolation using BEM naming conventions.

## Current Status

### Budget Component

- ✅ Implemented proper BEM naming for CSS
- ✅ Added Budget component to component_registry.json
- ✅ Fixed CSS file path in registry to use proper directory structure
- ✅ Moved budget.css to budget/budget-component.css
- ✅ Fixed tab naming patterns to match other components
- ✅ Converted Budget to use nav-item pattern in left-panel-footer
- ✅ Adjusted spacing and styling for consistency across footer items
- ✅ Implemented `budget_switchTab` function for tab navigation
- ✅ Integrated with minimal-loader for standard component loading

### Profile Component
- ✅ Converted to nav-item pattern matching Budget component
- ✅ Updated event handlers in ui-manager-core.js
- ✅ Component registry entries updated and verified
- ✅ Dedicated CSS file implemented with BEM naming
- ✅ Implemented `profile_switchTab` function for internal tab navigation
- ✅ Added `profile_saveProfile` and `profile_resetChanges` functions
- ✅ Moved profile-manager.js and profile-ui.js to scripts/profile directory
- ✅ Updated to use standard html-panel instead of separate profile-panel
- ✅ Added to minimal-loader component paths for consistent loading
- ✅ Removed special panel handling methods from ui-manager-core.js
- ✅ Fixed component loading path issues with absolute paths

### Settings Component
- ✅ Converted to nav-item pattern matching Budget component
- ✅ Updated event handlers in ui-manager-core.js
- ✅ Component registry entries updated and verified
- ✅ Dedicated CSS file implemented with BEM naming
- ✅ Implemented `settings_switchTab` function for internal tab navigation
- ✅ Added `settings_saveAllSettings` and `settings_resetAllSettings` functions
- ✅ Moved settings-manager.js and settings-ui.js to scripts/settings directory
- ✅ Updated to use standard html-panel instead of separate settings-panel
- ✅ Added to minimal-loader component paths for consistent loading
- ✅ Removed special panel handling methods from ui-manager-core.js
- ✅ Fixed component loading path issues with absolute paths

## Remaining Tasks
1. ✅ Implement `profile_switchTab` function in Profile component to handle internal tab navigation
2. ✅ Implement `settings_switchTab` function in Settings component to handle internal tab navigation 
3. ✅ Move profile-manager.js and profile-ui.js to scripts/profile directory
4. ✅ Move settings-manager.js and settings-ui.js to scripts/settings directory
5. ✅ Update ui-manager-core.js and index.html to use html-panel instead of separate panels
6. ✅ Add Profile and Settings components to minimal-loader
7. ✅ Update Profile and Settings to use absolute paths for component loading
8. ✅ Remove special panel handlers from UI Manager
9. Test Budget, Profile, and Settings functionality thoroughly with minimal-loader
10. Verify consistent appearance across different themes
11. Perform final review of BEM naming consistency

## Implementation Notes
- Used Athena component as the "golden reference" for implementation
- Followed BEM naming conventions throughout
- Created consistent spacing and styling in the footer section
- Converted buttons to nav-items for UI consistency
- Added proper data attributes for component identification
- All three components have similar tab switching functions for internal navigation:
  - Budget has `budget_switchTab` function
  - Profile has `profile_switchTab` function
  - Settings has `settings_switchTab` function
- Standardized on Clean Slate architecture for all components:
  - Using html-panel for all components (removed separate panels)
  - Organized files in component-specific directories
  - Updated UI Manager to use html-panel for all components
- Used standard component loading strategies for all components:
  - Applied minimal-loader for all components including Profile and Settings
  - Avoided special cases and complex custom loaders
  - Standardized on a simple, consistent approach across all components
  - Followed Clean Slate architecture principles consistently

## Current Structure
- The three footer components are now aligned with the Clean Slate architecture pattern:
  - All use the html-panel for rendering
  - All use component-specific directories for scripts and styles
  - All follow the same tab switching pattern for internal navigation
  - All use the same BEM naming conventions for CSS
  - Removed separate settings-panel and profile-panel in favor of standard html-panel
  - All components (Budget, Profile, Settings) use the standard minimal-loader mechanism
  - No special cases or custom loaders needed

The implementation is complete with a clean, consistent approach using standard loading mechanisms for all components.
