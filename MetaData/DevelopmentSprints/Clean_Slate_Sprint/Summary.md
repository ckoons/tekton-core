# Clean Slate Sprint - Summary

## Sprint Progress Update

The Clean Slate Sprint has made significant progress in implementing the new UI component architecture. The following work has been completed:

1. **Foundation and Component Loader**
   - Created a simplified minimal component loader that uses direct HTML injection
   - Established the golden component template with BEM naming convention
   - Defined clear component contracts and boundaries

2. **Component Implementations**
   - **Athena Component**: Converted to BEM naming and container-scoped DOM manipulation
     - Implemented tab switching functionality
     - Created query builder feature
     - Added proper component initialization with state management

   - **Ergon Component**: Fully migrated to Clean Slate architecture
     - Converted all CSS to BEM naming convention for isolation
     - Implemented container-scoped DOM queries
     - Enhanced chat functionality with typing indicators
     - Added proper modal forms for agent management

3. **Documentation**
   - Created [Clean Slate UI Implementation](CleanSlateUIImplementation.md) guide
   - Documented the [Ergon Component Migration](ErgonComponentMigration.md) process
   - Updated the README with current progress
   - Added detailed implementation examples

## Initial Sprint Preparation

The Clean Slate Sprint was prepared with comprehensive documentation following the Tekton Development Sprint process:

1. **[Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md)** - Outlines the high-level goals, approach, timeline, and success criteria for rebuilding the UI component architecture with a focus on reliability and maintainability.

2. **[Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md)** - Documents three key architectural decisions:
   - Strict Component Isolation
   - Template-Based Component Development
   - Progressive Enhancement for Component Features

3. **[Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md)** - Provides detailed implementation tasks across three phases:
   - Phase 1: Foundation and Component Loader
   - Phase 2: Component Implementation
   - Phase 3: Validation and Documentation

4. **[Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md)** - Detailed guide for AI assistants implementing the sprint, with specific guidelines for each phase and file.

5. **[README.md](README.md)** - General guidance for the sprint, including working guidelines and checklists.

## Next Steps

The remaining tasks for the sprint include:

1. Create a comprehensive component test harness
2. Develop a troubleshooting guide for common component issues
3. Apply the Clean Slate architecture to additional components as needed
4. Finalize any remaining documentation

The methodical approach outlined in these documents provides a clear path forward with an emphasis on reliability, restraint, and progressive enhancement.

## Key Principles

The sprint is guided by these key principles:

1. **Strict Component Isolation** - Components operate only within their containers
2. **Template-Based Development** - All components follow the same patterns
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality first, features later
4. **Methodical Implementation** - Small, validated steps with clear checkpoints

By following these principles and the detailed plans, we will establish a solid foundation for the Tekton UI components that addresses the persistent issues encountered in previous implementations.
