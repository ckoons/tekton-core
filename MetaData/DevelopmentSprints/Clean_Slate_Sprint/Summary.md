# Clean Slate Sprint - Summary

## Sprint Preparation Complete

The Clean Slate Sprint has been prepared with comprehensive documentation following the Tekton Development Sprint process. The following artifacts have been created:

1. **[Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md)** - Outlines the high-level goals, approach, timeline, and success criteria for rebuilding the UI component architecture with a focus on reliability and maintainability.

2. **[Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md)** - Documents three key architectural decisions:
   - Strict Component Isolation
   - Template-Based Component Development
   - Progressive Enhancement for Component Features

3. **[Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md)** - Provides detailed implementation tasks across three phases:
   - Phase 1: Foundation and Component Loader
   - Phase 2: Component Implementation
   - Phase 3: Validation and Documentation

4. **[Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md)** - Detailed guide for AI assistants implementing the sprint, with specific guidelines for each phase and file.

5. **[README.md](README.md)** - General guidance for the sprint, including working guidelines and checklists.

## Next Steps

The sprint is ready to begin implementation. The first steps are:

1. Verify that the working branch is `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125`
2. Begin Phase 1 by analyzing the existing component loader
3. Create the simplified component loader
4. Establish the golden component template

The methodical approach outlined in these documents provides a clear path forward with an emphasis on reliability, restraint, and progressive enhancement.

## Key Principles

The sprint is guided by these key principles:

1. **Strict Component Isolation** - Components operate only within their containers
2. **Template-Based Development** - All components follow the same patterns
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Core functionality first, features later
4. **Methodical Implementation** - Small, validated steps with clear checkpoints

By following these principles and the detailed plans, we will establish a solid foundation for the Tekton UI components that addresses the persistent issues encountered in previous implementations.
