# Footer Components - Architectural Decisions

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for implementing the Budget, Profile, and Settings components as part of the Clean Slate architecture. These decisions build upon the foundation established in the main Clean Slate Sprint and ensure consistency with the existing components.

## Architectural Decision 1: Footer Component Integration Pattern

### Context
The Budget, Profile, and Settings components need to be integrated into the Tekton UI as footer components, distinct from the main panel components. This requires a decision on how to structure and position these components within the UI.

### Decision
The footer components will follow a consistent integration pattern:

1. Components will be positioned in the bottom panel of the Tekton UI
2. Each component will use the same base structure as the main components (tabs, panels)
3. Components will maintain a compact vertical footprint to maximize usable space
4. Components will expand vertically when needed (e.g., for detailed settings panels)
5. Components will follow the same lifecycle and initialization patterns as main components

### Rationale
This approach ensures:
- Consistency with the established UI architecture
- Efficient use of screen real estate
- User familiarity through consistent patterns
- Maintainability through standardized component structure
- Proper isolation through established boundaries

### Implications
- Footer components need additional responsive behavior for vertical expansion
- Navigation between footer components must be consistent with the main navigation
- Components must be designed with vertical space constraints in mind
- Initial rendering must be compact by default

## Architectural Decision 2: User Data Persistence Strategy

### Context
The footer components deal with user-specific data (profiles, settings, budget preferences) that should persist across sessions. This requires a decision on data storage and synchronization mechanisms.

### Decision
The components will implement a multi-tiered data persistence strategy:

1. **Local Storage** for immediate persistence of user preferences
   - BEM-scoped keys to prevent collisions
   - JSON serialization for structured data
   - Automatic loading on component initialization

2. **Backend API Integration** for cross-device synchronization
   - RESTful API endpoints for data synchronization
   - Optimistic UI updates with background synchronization
   - Conflict resolution with user notification

3. **Default Values** for fallback and initialization
   - Component-defined defaults for all settings
   - Progressive enhancement when saved values exist
   - Clear reset mechanisms for returning to defaults

### Rationale
This approach ensures:
- Immediate response to user settings changes
- Persistence across page refreshes
- Cross-device synchronization when backend is available
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Clear initialization states for new users

### Implications
- Components must include proper error handling for failed synchronization
- Local and remote data must be reconciled on component initialization
- User feedback must be provided for synchronization status
- Reset mechanisms must be clearly implemented and explained

## Architectural Decision 3: Footer Component State Management

### Context
Footer components need to manage application-wide state (e.g., theme settings, user preferences) that affects other components. This requires careful consideration of state management to maintain component isolation.

### Decision
Footer components will implement a controlled state management pattern:

1. **Component-Local State** for component-specific settings
   - BEM-scoped properties
   - Isolated DOM queries
   - Component-specific event handlers

2. **Event-Based Communication** for cross-component effects
   - Custom events for broadcasting changes
   - Event namespacing to prevent conflicts
   - One-way data flow (state changes → events → effects)

3. **Configuration Service** for application-wide settings
   - Centralized configuration service for global settings
   - Component interaction only through service API
   - Clear contracts for setting changes

### Rationale
This approach ensures:
- Maintenance of component isolation principles
- Controlled cross-component effects
- Clear traceability of state changes
- Consistent patterns for settings management
- Testability through defined interfaces

### Implications
- Components must use custom events for cross-component communication
- Global effects must be implemented through central services
- Components must include proper cleanup of event listeners
- Debugging tools must trace event propagation

## Architectural Decision 4: Form Management in Footer Components

### Context
Footer components involve multiple forms for user input (profile information, settings configuration, budget management). These forms need consistent patterns for validation, submission, and error handling.

### Decision
All form interactions in footer components will follow a consistent pattern:

1. **Modular Form Structure**
   - Each logical group as a separate form section
   - Progressive disclosure for complex forms
   - Inline validation with immediate feedback

2. **Two-Phase Submit Process**
   - Validation phase with clear error indication
   - Submission phase with loading indicators
   - Success/failure confirmation

3. **State Preservation**
   - Auto-save for work in progress
   - Form state persistence across tab changes
   - Clear distinction between saved/unsaved states

### Rationale
This approach ensures:
- Consistent user experience across all forms
- Clear feedback on validation and submission
- Prevention of data loss during navigation
- Simplified form state management
- Improved usability for complex configuration

### Implications
- Components must implement consistent validation patterns
- Forms must include proper loading and error states
- Auto-save functionality must be clearly indicated to users
- Tab switching must preserve form state appropriately

## Architectural Decision 5: Debug Instrumentation for Footer Components

### Context
Consistent with the Clean Slate approach, footer components need proper debug instrumentation for troubleshooting and development support. This requires a decision on how to implement debug features in the context of footer components.

### Decision
Footer components will implement debug instrumentation through:

1. **Component-Specific Debug Panels**
   - Hidden debug panel in each component
   - Toggle through special key combination
   - Display of component state and events

2. **Integration with Debug Shim**
   - Use of the established debug-shim.js
   - Event logging for component lifecycle
   - Performance tracking for operations

3. **Documentation-Driven Instrumentation**
   - Clear documentation of debug features
   - Standard debug patterns across components
   - Consistent naming for debug functions

### Rationale
This approach ensures:
- Consistency with established debug patterns
- Ease of troubleshooting during development
- Clear visibility into component state
- Standardized approach to debug information
- Improved maintainability through instrumentation

### Implications
- All components must implement the debug panel pattern
- Debug features must be easily toggled without code changes
- Debug instrumentation must not impact production performance
- Documentation must clearly explain debug capabilities
