# Clean Slate Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made during the Clean Slate Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The architectural decisions in this document focus on rebuilding the UI component architecture with emphasis on reliability, maintainability, and proper isolation.

## Decision 1: Strict Component Isolation

### Context

Previous component implementations have suffered from interference between components, where changes to one component affect others. Components have been taking over the entire UI or modifying shared resources in unpredictable ways. This has led to cascading failures and difficulty in maintaining the codebase.

### Decision

Implement strict component isolation where:
1. Each component operates only within its own DOM container
2. Component CSS uses BEM notation with unique component prefixes
3. Component JS is scoped to the component's container
4. Components communicate with the main UI only through defined interfaces
5. Components never modify global UI state directly

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Shared UI State Management

**Pros:**
- Potentially more powerful inter-component communication
- Centralized state management
- Potentially simpler code for managing complex UIs

**Cons:**
- Higher risk of components affecting each other
- More complex to implement correctly
- Requires more sophisticated patterns
- Higher learning curve for new developers

#### Alternative 2: Component Micro-Frontends

**Pros:**
- Complete isolation (even separate builds)
- Independent technology choices per component
- Fully decoupled development

**Cons:**
- Significantly more complex build system
- Overhead for simple components
- Potential performance issues with multiple frameworks
- Excessive for current project needs

### Decision Rationale

Strict component isolation was chosen because it provides the necessary separation to prevent components from interfering with each other while remaining straightforward to implement. The primary goal of this sprint is reliability, and isolation directly addresses the most critical issues we've observed.

The shared state management approach would be more powerful but also introduces more complexity and risk. The micro-frontend approach would be excessive for our needs and introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Implications

- **Performance**: Minimal impact; may slightly increase memory usage with duplicated code
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved as components are isolated
- **Extensibility**: Components are well-defined units that can be enhanced independently
- **Security**: Improved as components have reduced ability to access global state
- **Learning curve**: Simpler for developers as patterns are more explicit and consistent
- **Integration**: Components integrate via well-defined interfaces rather than shared state

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Components must never use absolute positioning that takes over the container
2. Component CSS classes must follow BEM notation with component name as the block prefix
3. Component JS must query elements only within its container (no global selectors)
4. All state must be contained within the component or passed through defined interfaces
5. Component initialization must be idempotent (safe to call multiple times)

## Decision 2: Template-Based Component Development

### Context

Component implementations have been inconsistent, with each new component following its own patterns and structure. This has made it difficult to understand, maintain, and extend components. When issues arise, each component must be debugged independently.

### Decision

Adopt a template-based approach to component development where:
1. A "golden" template defines the structure for all components
2. All new components start by copying this template exactly
3. Modifications are minimal and follow strictly defined patterns
4. Components share a common lifecyle and initialization pattern

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Component Framework/Library

**Pros:**
- More enforced consistency
- Potentially more powerful abstractions
- Reduced boilerplate code

**Cons:**
- Additional dependency
- Learning curve for framework
- Potential lock-in
- Complexity when framework concepts don't match needs

#### Alternative 2: Component Generator

**Pros:**
- Automated creation of component skeletons
- Enforced consistency through generation
- Can incorporate best practices automatically

**Cons:**
- Additional tooling to maintain
- Still allows post-generation divergence
- Overhead for simple components
- Requires maintenance as patterns evolve

### Decision Rationale

The template-based approach was chosen for its simplicity and directness. Given the current state of the project and the focus on reliability, adding a framework or generator would introduce unnecessary complexity. 

By using a simple, well-documented template, we achieve the necessary consistency while keeping the implementation straightforward. This approach is also easier to evolve over time as we learn from implementation experience.

### Implications

- **Performance**: No significant impact
- **Maintainability**: Improved through consistency and predictability
- **Extensibility**: Clear pattern for adding new components
- **Learning curve**: Simple to understand and adopt
- **Integration**: Consistent integration pattern across all components

### Implementation Guidelines

1. The template should include HTML, CSS, and JS with clear placeholder markers
2. CSS should follow BEM notation with a component prefix
3. JS should follow a standard lifecycle pattern (init, activate, teardown)
4. Components should have consistent interfaces for activation and state handling
5. Documentation should clearly explain how to adapt the template for new components

## Decision 3: Progressive Enhancement for Component Features

### Context

Previous component implementations attempted to build full functionality before ensuring the core loading and display worked correctly. This led to situations where complex features were being debugged alongside basic loading issues, making it difficult to isolate problems.

### Decision

Adopt a progressive enhancement approach where:
1. Components must first demonstrate basic loading and display in isolation
2. Features are added incrementally only after core functionality is stable
3. Each feature is validated in isolation before moving to the next
4. Changes are committed at stable checkpoints

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Feature-Complete Development

**Pros:**
- Faster development of all features
- Immediate validation of complete component
- Potentially less rework if design changes

**Cons:**
- Harder to diagnose issues when they arise
- More complex rollbacks when problems occur
- Greater chance of abandoning work due to fundamental issues

#### Alternative 2: Parallel Feature Development

**Pros:**
- Faster overall development time
- Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- Potentially better resource utilization

**Cons:**
- Increased complexity when integrating features
- Risk of conflicting implementation approaches
- Harder to identify which feature introduced issues

### Decision Rationale

The progressive enhancement approach was chosen because it directly addresses the pattern of failures observed in previous implementations. By ensuring that the foundation is solid before adding features, we significantly reduce the risk of fundamental issues that invalidate large amounts of work.

This approach may seem slower initially, but actually results in more reliable progress as each stage builds on a stable foundation. It also makes it easier to identify and fix issues as they arise.

### Implications

- **Development speed**: Potentially slower initial development, but faster overall when considering quality
- **Quality**: Significantly improved as each stage is validated
- **Debugging**: Easier to identify issues as they're introduced
- **Collaboration**: Clearer handoffs between development phases
- **Risk**: Reduced risk of major rework or abandoned work

### Implementation Guidelines

1. First phase must verify only that the component loads and displays correctly
2. Second phase adds basic interactivity and state management
3. Subsequent phases add specific features in order of priority
4. Each phase should end with a stable, committable state
5. Tests should be added with each feature addition

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Considerations

- Components should initialize lazily when activated, not on page load
- CSS should be scoped to minimize style calculations
- JS should use efficient DOM manipulation (batch updates, avoid repeated queries)
- Components should handle cleanup properly to prevent memory leaks

### Security Considerations

- Components should sanitize any user-provided content before rendering
- Components should not use eval() or similarly dangerous patterns
- External content should be properly validated and sanitized

### Maintainability Considerations

- Component code should be well-commented, especially non-obvious behavior
- CSS should follow BEM conventions consistently
- JS should avoid complex, nested logic
- Functions should be small and focused on a single responsibility
- Magic numbers and values should be explained or made into named constants

### Scalability Considerations

- Component architecture should support adding new components without modification
- Loading mechanism should handle many components efficiently
- CSS should not rely on global resets or complex selector specificity

## Future Considerations

- Development of a more formal component registry system
- Potential implementation of a shared state management system once basics are solid
- Component communication mechanisms for more complex interactions
- Formalized testing patterns for component verification
- Documentation generation from component code
