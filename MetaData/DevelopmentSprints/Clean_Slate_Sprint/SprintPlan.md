# Clean Slate Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Clean Slate Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes for rebuilding the Tekton UI component architecture with a focus on stability, consistency, and maintainability.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on establishing a reliable, standardized UI component system that addresses the persistent issues encountered in previous implementations.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Create a Minimal Viable Component Loader**: Develop a simple, reliable loader that can consistently display components in the RIGHT PANEL
2. **Establish a Gold Standard Component Template**: Create a template that all components will follow for consistency and reliability
3. **Implement Strict Component Boundaries**: Ensure each component operates within its own scope without affecting others
4. **Create a Progressive Enhancement Path**: Allow for incremental feature additions only after core functionality is stable

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Reducing Technical Debt**: Replacing unstable UI implementations with a clean, maintainable architecture
- **Enabling Future Development**: Creating a solid foundation for upcoming feature development
- **Improving User Experience**: Ensuring consistent, reliable behavior across all components
- **Facilitating Testing**: Making components easier to test and validate in isolation
- **Reducing Development Friction**: Establishing clear patterns for future component development

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The current UI implementation suffers from several issues:

- Components inconsistently implement positioning, leading to layout problems
- Changes to one component often unexpectedly affect other components
- No clear separation between component loading and component functionality
- Lack of a standardized pattern for component development
- Multiple versions of components exist in different locations
- BEM CSS naming convention is implemented inconsistently

### Pain Points

1. **Component Interference**: Components modify shared DOM elements in ways that affect other components
2. **Inconsistent Loading**: Component loading mechanism is fragile and prone to errors
3. **Positioning Issues**: Absolute positioning causes components to take over the entire UI or be rendered incorrectly
4. **Multiple Implementations**: Different approaches to similar problems across components
5. **File Path Confusion**: Components loaded from inconsistent paths

## Proposed Approach

We will adopt a methodical, incremental approach that focuses on establishing core functionality before adding features:

1. Start with a clean state by reverting to a known working configuration
2. Create a minimal component loader that does exactly one thing: load components into the RIGHT PANEL
3. Establish a "golden" component template based on the working Athena component
4. Implement components one at a time, following the template exactly until proven working
5. Add tests for each component to verify correct loading and behavior
6. Document the pattern explicitly for future component development

### Key Components Affected

- **Component Loader**: Simplified to focus solely on reliable loading
- **Component Templates**: New standardized templates for HTML, CSS, and JS
- **Athena Component**: Used as reference but not modified
- **Ergon Component**: Reimplemented following the new pattern
- **UI Documentation**: Updated to reflect the new architecture and patterns

### Technical Approach

- **Strict Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between components and the main UI
- **Template-Based Development**: All components start from the same verified template
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, features only after loading works
- **Explicit Contracts**: Clear documentation of how components interact with the UI
- **Testing Checkpoints**: Verification at each step before proceeding

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Adding new features to existing components
- Refactoring backend services
- Modifying the component registration system
- Changing the overall UI layout or design
- Enhancing component functionality beyond basic loading and display

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Access to the main branch in a clean state
- Original Athena component implementation as reference
- Understanding of the UI layout and panel structure
- Documentation of the component loading mechanism

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation and Component Loader
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Creating minimal component loader and establishing patterns
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Minimal component loader implementation
  - Golden component template (HTML, CSS, JS)
  - Documentation of component contract

### Phase 2: Component Implementation
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Focus**: Implementing components following the template
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Reimplemented Ergon component
  - Test harness for component verification
  - Component test suite

### Phase 3: Validation and Documentation
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Focus**: Testing, validation, and documentation
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Complete test suite
  - Updated documentation
  - Developer guide for component implementation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Component changes affect other components | High | Medium | Strict isolation of component CSS and JS |
| Path resolution issues for component assets | Medium | Medium | Standardize asset paths and add fallbacks |
| Component state persistence problems | Medium | Low | Clear state management patterns with isolation |
| Unexpected browser-specific rendering issues | Medium | Low | Test on multiple browsers early |
| Overcomplicated solutions | High | Medium | Ruthlessly eliminate unnecessary complexity |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Components load reliably in the RIGHT PANEL without affecting each other
- The Ergon component follows the established pattern exactly
- All components maintain their own state without leaking
- The component contract is clearly documented
- A developer can follow the pattern to create a new component
- Components gracefully handle errors during loading

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Alan**: AI architect for this sprint
- **Future Developers**: Anyone who will create or modify components
