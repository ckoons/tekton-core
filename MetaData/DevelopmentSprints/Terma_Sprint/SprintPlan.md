# Terma Sprint Plan

## Sprint Duration
Estimated: 3-4 development sessions

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Implement core terminal control with async shell management
2. Integrate Rhetor for natural language understanding
3. Build safety mechanisms for dangerous operations
4. Create stateful context management
5. Enable pattern learning and optimization

### Secondary Goals
- Integration with Engram for pattern persistence
- Katra support for different terminal personalities
- Performance monitoring and optimization

## Team Roles

- **Architect**: Design terminal architecture and Rhetor integration
- **Developer**: Implement core functionality
- **Tester**: Validate safety and accuracy
- **Casey**: Product guidance and integration oversight

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Session 1)
- Core terminal controller
- Async shell process management
- Basic stdin/stdout handling
- Simple command execution

### Phase 2: Intelligence (Session 2)
- Rhetor integration
- Natural language to bash translation
- Output parsing and structuring
- Error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Safety & Context (Session 3)
- Destructive operation detection
- Confirmation workflows
- Context state management
- Environment and directory tracking

### Phase 4: Learning & Integration (Session 4)
- Pattern recognition and storage
- Integration with Engram
- Tekton component commands
- Testing and refinement

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Command Translation Accuracy
**Mitigation**: Start with common patterns, build comprehensive test suite

### Risk: Destructive Operations
**Mitigation**: Multiple safety layers, dry-run mode, explicit confirmations

### Risk: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Mitigation**: Abstract shell operations, test on multiple platforms

### Risk: Performance with Long-Running Commands
**Mitigation**: Async execution, streaming output, timeout controls

## Success Metrics

- 95%+ accuracy on common commands
- Zero unconfirmed destructive operations
- <100ms translation time for natural language
- Successful pattern learning improves accuracy over time
- Clean integration with existing Tekton components
