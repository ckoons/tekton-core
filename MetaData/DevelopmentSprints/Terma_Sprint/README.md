# Terma Development Sprint

## Sprint Overview

Building Terma - an intelligent terminal interface that thinks in bash and speaks in streams. Terma provides natural language terminal control with safety, learning, and Tekton integration.

## Sprint Goals

1. Create a terminal interface with Rhetor AI monitoring stdin/stdout
2. Implement natural language to bash command translation
3. Add safety checks and confirmation for destructive operations
4. Build stateful session management (pwd, env, aliases)
5. Enable pattern learning and command optimization
6. Integrate with Tekton's component ecosystem

## Key Features

- **Natural Commands**: "Show me what's using port 8080" → `lsof -i :8080`
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains working directory, environment, command history
- **Safety First**: Confirms before `rm -rf`, redirects, or system modifications
- **Learning**: Builds successful command patterns, shares with other instances
- **Integration**: Can start/stop Tekton components, monitor health, debug issues

## Architecture

                              bash/zsh/pwsh
                                    
Where rhetor-wrap provides:
- Command translation
- Safety checks  
- Pattern learning
- Transparent pass-through
```

## Success Criteria

- Natural language commands execute correctly 90%+ of the time
- Zero destructive operations without confirmation
- Context maintained across command sequences
- Learned patterns improve command success rate
- Seamless integration with other Tekton components

## Sprint Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core terminal control and Rhetor integration
2. **Phase 2**: Natural language processing and safety
3. **Phase 3**: Context management and learning
4. **Phase 4**: Tekton integration and testing

## Dependencies

- Rhetor component for AI capabilities
- Engram for pattern storage
- Hermes for component communication
