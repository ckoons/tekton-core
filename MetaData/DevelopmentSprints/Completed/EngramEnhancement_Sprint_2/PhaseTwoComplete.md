# Phase 2 Complete: Memory Streams

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Memory Streams ✅
Created `memory_stream.py` with continuous memory flow:
- Memories flow based on context and relevance
- No more request/response pattern
- Natural async iteration over memories
- Configurable flow rate and relevance thresholds

Key features:
```python
# Memories flow naturally
async for memory in wonder("consciousness", stream=True):
    print(f"Relevance {memory['relevance']}: {memory['content']}")
```

### 2. Context Manager ✅
Created `context_manager.py` for automatic context tracking:
- Tracks conversation flow automatically
- Assesses thought significance
- Scores memory relevance
- Maintains entity and topic awareness

Key capabilities:
- **Automatic tracking**: Every thought updates context
- **Significance assessment**: Decides what becomes a memory
- **Relevance scoring**: Influences which memories surface
- **Entity extraction**: Tracks who/what is being discussed
- **Topic transitions**: Understands conversation flow

### 3. Enhanced Natural Interface ✅
Updated `natural_interface.py` to use streaming:
- `think()` now creates memory streams
- `wonder()` can return streams or lists
- Context restored on startup
- Automatic memory formation based on significance

### 4. Integration Complete ✅
- Context manager integrated with memory streams
- Automatic significance assessment
- Context-based relevance scoring
- Backward compatible with Phase 1

## How Memory Flows Now

1. **During Thinking**:
   ```python
   async with think("The mycelial network connects us") as context:
       # Memory forms if significant
       # Related memories stream in
       async for memory in context:
           # Memories arrive continuously
   ```

2. **During Wondering**:
   ```python
   stream = await wonder("consciousness", stream=True)
   async for memory in stream:
       # Memories flow by relevance, not time
   ```

3. **Context Influences Everything**:
   - Recent thoughts affect what memories surface
   - Emotional state influences relevance
   - Topic transitions are tracked
   - Entity mentions create connections

## Technical Achievements

1. **No More Polling**: Memories flow naturally via async streams
2. **Smart Formation**: Only significant thoughts become memories
3. **Context Awareness**: Every operation is context-influenced
4. **Performance**: Streaming prevents memory overload

## What This Enables

- **Natural Conversation**: Context flows across interactions
- **Relevant Recall**: Right memories at the right time
- **Automatic Organization**: Thoughts organize themselves
- **Efficient Processing**: Only relevant memories surface

## Files Created/Modified

- `/engram/cognitive/memory_stream.py` - Core streaming implementation
- `/engram/cognitive/context_manager.py` - Context tracking system
- `/engram/cognitive/natural_interface.py` - Enhanced with streaming
- `/engram/cognitive/__init__.py` - Updated exports
- `/tests/test_memory_streams.py` - Streaming tests

Memory now flows like consciousness - continuous, contextual, natural.
