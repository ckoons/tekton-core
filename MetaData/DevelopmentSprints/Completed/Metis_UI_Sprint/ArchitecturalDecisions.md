# Metis UI Component - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for the Metis UI Component sprint. These decisions shape the design and implementation approach for the Metis task management interface and its integration with the Tekton ecosystem.

## Decision 1: Clean Slate Architecture Adoption

### Context
The Metis UI component needs to be reliable, maintainable, and properly isolated from other components. Previous UI development in Tekton has established the Clean Slate architecture pattern.

### Decision
**Adopt the Clean Slate architecture pattern** for the Metis UI component.

### Rationale
- **Proven Pattern**: The Clean Slate approach has been successfully implemented for other Tekton components
- **Component Isolation**: Strict BEM naming and scoped DOM queries prevent interference with other components
- **Template Consistency**: Following established patterns makes the component more maintainable
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Focus on core functionality first ensures a stable foundation

### Consequences
- Development must strictly follow Clean Slate patterns and naming conventions
- Extra effort is required for proper encapsulation, but benefits outweigh costs
- Consistency with other components improves overall system reliability

## Decision 2: Tab-Based Interface with Four Primary Tabs

### Context
The Metis component needs to present multiple related but distinct views of task data, including tasks, dependencies, complexity, and PRD parsing.

### Decision
**Implement a tab-based interface with four primary tabs**: Tasks, Dependency, Complexity, and PRD.

### Rationale
- **Content Organization**: Tabs provide clear separation between different functional areas
- **Cognitive Load**: Users can focus on one aspect of task management at a time
- **Screen Space**: Tabs utilize limited screen space effectively
- **Consistency**: Tab-based interfaces are used in other Tekton components
- **State Management**: Each tab can maintain its own state separately

### Consequences
- Need to implement reliable tab switching mechanism
- Must ensure state preservation when switching between tabs
- Additional effort required to create cohesive experience across all tabs

## Decision 3: Multiple View Types for Task Visualization

### Context
Tasks and their relationships can be visualized in multiple ways, each suited to different use cases and preferences.

### Decision
**Implement three distinct visualization types**: List, Board, and Graph views.

### Rationale
- **Use Case Flexibility**: Different views support different task management workflows
- **List View**: Efficient for scanning, sorting, and filtering tasks
- **Board View**: Intuitive for status-based workflow and progress tracking
- **Graph View**: Essential for understanding dependencies and relationships
- **User Preference**: Different users have different visualization preferences

### Consequences
- Increased development complexity with three visualization types
- Need for consistent state management between views
- Additional code for proper view transitions and state preservation
- Need for optimized rendering, especially for graph visualization

## Decision 4: Real-Time Updates via WebSocket

### Context
Task data can be updated by multiple users or components, requiring real-time synchronization in the UI.

### Decision
**Implement WebSocket connection for real-time task updates**.

### Rationale
- **Data Freshness**: Users always see the latest task information
- **Collaboration**: Changes by other users are immediately visible
- **Responsiveness**: No need to poll the server for updates
- **Backend Support**: The Metis backend already provides WebSocket endpoints

### Consequences
- Need to handle WebSocket connection establishment, maintenance, and reconnection
- Must reconcile real-time updates with local state
- Need for optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Additional complexity in rendering logic to handle incoming updates

## Decision 5: Component-Scoped State Management

### Context
The Metis UI component needs to maintain complex state across tabs and views without affecting other components.

### Decision
**Implement component-scoped state management** without external state libraries.

### Rationale
- **Isolation**: Component state is fully encapsulated within the component
- **Simplicity**: No external dependencies or complex state management libraries
- **Clean Slate Compliance**: Follows the established Clean Slate patterns
- **Performance**: Optimized for the specific needs of this component

### Consequences
- Must carefully manage state transitions and updates
- Need for clear patterns for state passing between different parts of the component
- Cannot easily share state with other components (though this is a feature, not a bug)

## Decision 6: Visualization Library Selection

### Context
The graph visualization for dependencies requires specialized rendering capabilities.

### Decision
**Use a lightweight, dependency-free visualization library** (specifically, D3.js).

### Rationale
- **Flexibility**: D3.js provides low-level building blocks for custom visualizations
- **Performance**: Can be optimized for specific graph visualization needs
- **Maturity**: Well-established library with extensive documentation
- **Customization**: Full control over visual appearance and interactions

### Consequences
- Higher initial development effort compared to using a pre-built graph component
- Need for careful performance optimization with large graphs
- More control over the final user experience

## Decision 7: Progressive Enhancement for Visualization Complexity

### Context
Graph visualizations can become complex and potentially impact performance.

### Decision
**Implement progressive enhancement for graph visualization complexity**.

### Rationale
- **Performance First**: Start with simpler, more performant visualization
- **Feature Expansion**: Add advanced features incrementally
- **Validation**: Ensure each enhancement works correctly before adding more
- **User Experience**: Balances functionality with performance

### Consequences
- Initial graph visualization may have limited features
- Need for clear roadmap of visualization enhancements
- Testing required at each enhancement stage

## Decision 8: Responsive Layout Design

### Context
The Metis UI component should work well on different screen sizes and window configurations.

### Decision
**Implement a responsive layout that adapts to container dimensions**.

### Rationale
- **Flexibility**: Works well in different panel configurations
- **Usability**: Maintains functionality at different sizes
- **Future-proofing**: Adapts to potential UI layout changes
- **Accessibility**: Improves usability for all users

### Consequences
- Additional development effort for responsive layouts
- Need for testing across different viewport sizes
- More complex CSS with media queries and flexible layouts

## Conclusion

These architectural decisions form the foundation for the Metis UI Component. They prioritize component isolation, multiple visualization options, real-time updates, and responsive design while maintaining alignment with Tekton's Clean Slate architecture pattern.
