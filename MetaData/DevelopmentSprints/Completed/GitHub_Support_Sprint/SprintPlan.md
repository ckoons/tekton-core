# GitHub Support Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the GitHub Support Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on enhancing Tekton's integration with GitHub and improving the branch management experience for Development Sprints.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Create Branch Management Utilities**: Develop a suite of bash scripts to streamline branch management across multiple Tekton components
2. **Implement Branch Verification Tools**: Create utilities for Claude sessions to verify they are working on the correct branches
3. **Standardize GitHub Workflows**: Define and document standard practices for branch naming, commits, and PRs
4. **Enhance Development Sprint Documentation**: Update process documentation to incorporate GitHub best practices
5. **Improve Claude's GitHub Interaction**: Provide clear guidance and tools for Claude sessions working with GitHub

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- Reducing errors and inconsistencies in branch management
- Streamlining Development Sprint workflows
- Improving collaboration between human developers and Claude sessions
- Ensuring consistent code quality through standardized processes
- Reducing time spent on manual branch management tasks
- Preventing incidents where work might occur on incorrect branches

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Currently, Tekton has minimal standardized support for managing GitHub workflows:

- No utilities for creating branches across multiple components
- No tools for Claude to verify branch status
- Inconsistent branch naming and management practices
- Limited documentation on GitHub workflows for Development Sprints
- Manual processes for managing branches across components

### Pain Points

- Claude sessions sometimes work on incorrect branches
- Branch creation across multiple components is manual and error-prone
- Difficulty tracking which branches correspond across components
- Inconsistent commit messages and PR descriptions
- No standard verification process for branch status
- Manual effort required to manage Development Sprint branches

## Proposed Approach

We will create a comprehensive set of utilities and documentation to address these issues:

1. **Script Development**: Create bash scripts for common GitHub tasks
2. **Documentation**: Update Development Sprint documentation
3. **Verification Tools**: Implement tools for branch verification
4. **Templates**: Create templates for commits and PRs
5. **Integration**: Ensure all tools work together seamlessly

### Key Components Affected

- **Tekton Scripts Directory**: New utilities will be added
- **Development Sprint Documentation**: Will be updated with GitHub workflow guidance
- **Branch Management Process**: Will be standardized and documented
- **Claude Code Prompts**: Will be updated to include branch verification steps

### Technical Approach

- Implement branch management utilities as bash scripts
- Create documentation in Markdown format
- Develop branch verification tools that Claude can use
- Design the system to be extensible for future enhancements
- Ensure all scripts work consistently across different environments

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Integration with GitHub API for advanced operations
- Automated testing of branches beyond basic verification
- Web interfaces for branch management
- Integration with CI/CD systems
- Changes to GitHub repository permissions or settings
- Authentication/authorization for GitHub operations

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Access to git command-line tools
- Basic bash scripting environment
- Documentation of the current Development Sprint process
- Understanding of Tekton's component structure

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Core Utilities Development
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Implement core branch management scripts
- **Key Deliverables**: Basic branch management utilities, script library

### Phase 2: Verification Tools and Integration
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Create verification tools and integrate with existing processes
- **Key Deliverables**: Branch verification utilities, integration with Development Sprint process

### Phase 3: Documentation and Refinement
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Update documentation and refine utilities based on testing
- **Key Deliverables**: Comprehensive documentation, polished utilities, templates

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Script compatibility across different environments | High | Medium | Test scripts in multiple environments, implement environment detection |
| Complex component dependencies affecting branch management | Medium | High | Create detailed documentation, implement careful dependency tracking |
| Claude sessions struggling with git operations | High | Medium | Provide clear step-by-step instructions, implement verification checks |
| Changes to GitHub causing script failures | Medium | Low | Design scripts to be robust and check for errors, document limitations |
| Security concerns with script automation | High | Low | Avoid storing credentials, use standard security practices |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Branch management utilities are working across all components
- Claude sessions can reliably verify branch status
- Documentation clearly describes the GitHub workflow
- Templates are available for commits and PRs
- Development Sprint process documentation is updated to reflect GitHub practices
- At least one test Development Sprint successfully uses the new utilities

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Architect Claude**: AI assistant focused on planning and architecture
- **Working Claude**: AI assistant focused on implementation
