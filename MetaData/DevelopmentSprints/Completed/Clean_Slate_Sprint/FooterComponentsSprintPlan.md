# Footer Components Sprint Plan

## Overview

The Footer Components Sprint focuses on completing the Clean Slate implementation of the three remaining footer components: Budget, Profile, and Settings. This sprint follows the successful completion of the main Clean Slate Sprint, which established a solid foundation for Tekton's UI components by implementing the core components (Athena, Ergon, Hermes, Engram, Rhetor, Prometheus, and Tekton Core) with strict isolation and consistent patterns.

The footer components require the same meticulous attention to detail and adherence to the established architectural patterns. These components will provide essential functionality for user profile management, application settings, and budget/resource tracking.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Complete the UI Component Architecture** - Finish implementing all planned components following the Clean Slate architecture
2. **Maintain Strict Component Isolation** - Ensure all new components operate within their own containers without affecting others
3. **Follow the Golden Template** - Implement all components using the established Athena pattern
4. **Add Debug Instrumentation** - Incorporate the debug shim for troubleshooting and monitoring
5. **Enhance User Control** - Provide users with comprehensive profile, settings, and budget management capabilities

## Success Criteria

1. All three footer components (Budget, Profile, Settings) load correctly in the UI
2. Components follow BEM naming conventions with proper CSS isolation
3. Components use container-scoped JavaScript with lifecycle methods
4. All components include proper debug instrumentation
5. UI remains visually consistent with existing Clean Slate components
6. Components function correctly with expected features

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Preparation and Planning** (1 day)
   - Complete sprint documentation
   - Analyze existing component code
   - Define specific requirements for each component

2. **Phase 2: Implementation** (3 days)
   - Implement Budget component following Clean Slate architecture
   - Implement Profile component following Clean Slate architecture
   - Implement Settings component following Clean Slate architecture

3. **Phase 3: Testing and Validation** (1 day)
   - Test all components individually
   - Test component interactions
   - Validate proper isolation
   - Check for visual consistency

4. **Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization** (1 day)
   - Update component documentation
   - Create implementation guides
   - Update Clean Slate Sprint summary
   - Prepare final commit

## Key Principles

This sprint follows the key principles established in the Clean Slate Sprint:

1. **Strict Component Isolation**: Components operate only within their own container without affecting others
2. **Template-Based Development**: All components follow the same basic template and patterns
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality is implemented and validated before adding features
4. **Clear Contracts**: Well-defined interfaces between components and the main UI
5. **Methodical Implementation**: Changes are incremental and validated at each step

## Component Descriptions

### Budget Component

The Budget component provides users with functionality to monitor and manage resource usage and financial aspects of Tekton operation. It should include:

1. **Dashboard Tab** - For viewing overall usage metrics and spending
2. **Usage Details Tab** - For detailed usage statistics with filtering
3. **Budget Settings Tab** - For setting and managing budget limits
4. **Alerts Tab** - For configuring budget-related alerts
5. **Team Chat Tab** - For team communication about budget matters

### Profile Component

The Profile component allows users to manage their personal information and preferences. It should include:

1. **Personal Info Tab** - For managing name, email, and bio
2. **Contact Tab** - For managing contact information
3. **Social Accounts Tab** - For linking social media accounts
4. **Security Tab** - For password management and two-factor authentication
5. **Preferences Tab** - For user-specific preferences

### Settings Component

The Settings component provides application-wide configuration options. It should include:

1. **Theme Tab** - For customizing application appearance (light/dark mode, accent colors)
2. **Interface Tab** - For general UI settings
3. **Terminal Tab** - For configuring terminal appearance and behavior
4. **Chat Tab** - For configuring chat behavior and history settings
5. **Hermes Tab** - For Hermes integration settings
6. **System Tab** - For system-wide settings and reset options

## Directory Structure

All components will follow the established directory structure:

```

├── components/
│   ├── budget/
│   │   └── budget-component.html
│   ├── profile/
│   │   └── profile-component.html

## Resources

### Reference Components
- Athena component (golden template)
- Ergon component
- Other completed Clean Slate components

### Debug Instrumentation
- Debug shim for frontend instrumentation
- Debug utilities for backend support

## Working Guidelines

For Claude Code sessions and development work during this sprint, follow these guidelines:

1. **Validate Branch First**: Always verify you're working on the correct branch before making changes
    ```bash
    git branch
    # Should show you are on sprint/Clean_Slate_051125
    ```

2. **Start Simple**: Focus on basic functionality before adding complexity
    - First make sure component loads correctly
    - Then add basic interactivity
    - Add more advanced features only after basics work

3. **Commit at Stable Points**: Create commits whenever you reach a stable point
    - Commit after component loads correctly
    - Commit after basic interactivity works
    - Commit after each feature is added

4. **Follow Established Patterns**: 
    - Use BEM naming for CSS: `.component__element--modifier`
    - Follow the lifecycle pattern in JS: `init()`, `activate()`, `cleanup()`
    - Match the HTML structure from the golden template

5. **Test Before Moving On**:
    - Verify component loads without errors
    - Check that styles apply correctly and don't leak
    - Confirm behavior matches expectations

6. **Documentation**:
    - Update documentation alongside code changes
    - Document any challenges or decisions made
    - Create examples for future reference
