# Tekton Core Development Plan - Clean Slate Sprint

## Overview

This document outlines the phased development plan for Tekton Core, establishing it as the central project management hub of the Tekton ecosystem. The development is structured in progressive phases, with Phase 1 targeted for the current Clean Slate Sprint, and subsequent phases planned for future sprints.

## Phase 1: Project-Centric Foundation (Current Sprint)

The initial phase focuses on establishing a solid project-centric foundation with core GitHub integration.

### Core Structure
1. **Project Manager UI Redesign**
   - Project selection dashboard with filterable project list
   - Directory tree sidebar for project navigation
   - Contextual action panel that adapts based on current selection
   - Basic project metadata display (repository, branch, status)
   - Consistent BEM-styled UI following Clean Slate Architecture

### Basic Operations
1. **GitHub Core Integration**
   - Repository clone/fetch/pull operations using MCP GitHub functions
   - Basic branch management (create, checkout, merge)
   - Commit and push functionality with standardized templates
   - Repository status dashboard with health indicators
   - Error handling and recovery for GitHub operations

### Project Configuration
1. **Project Setup Workflow**
   - New project wizard with starter templates
   - GitHub repository linking and upstream relationship management
   - Basic environment setup (development environment)
   - README generation and management with templated sections
   - Project configuration storage and versioning

## Implementation Priority for Current Sprint

1. **Core UI Structure Implementation**
   - Implement the project-centric UI with proper BEM naming and isolation
   - Create the three-panel layout (project list, directory tree, action panel)
   - Ensure responsive design and proper containment
   - Set up tab navigation for different project contexts

2. **Basic GitHub Operations**
   - Implement GitHub service with MCP functions
   - Create basic project management functionality
   - Set up error handling and recovery
   - Enable project cloning and basic management

3. **Project Template System**
   - Implement basic project template structure
   - Create template selection UI
   - Enable README generation from templates
   - Set up basic configuration management

## Subsequent Phases (Future Sprints)

The following phases are documented for planning purposes and will be implemented in future sprints.

### Phase 2: Advanced Project Management

1. **Workflow Automation**
   - Sprint management workflows
   - PR creation and management
   - Task tracking integration
   - Documentation automation

2. **Environment Management**
   - Multi-environment support (dev/test/staging/prod)
   - Environment configuration templates
   - Environment-specific variables
   - Deployment script generation

3. **Documentation System**
   - Integrated documentation management
   - API documentation generation
   - Usage guide templating
   - Configuration documentation

### Phase 3: Project Intelligence

1. **Repository Analytics**
   - Code change velocity metrics
   - Commit pattern analysis
   - Branch activity visualization
   - Contributor statistics

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Upstream/downstream relationship tracking
   - Submodule operations and visualization
   - Dependency graph generation
   - Dependency update workflows

3. **Search & Discovery**
   - Cross-project code search
   - Feature discovery tools
   - Implementation pattern search
   - Code reference visualization

### Phase 4: Advanced Workflows

1. **Capability Management**
   - Component registry integration
   - Interface compatibility verification
   - Breaking change detection
   - API contract validation

2. **Release Management**
   - Version management systems
   - Release note generation
   - Release packaging
   - Deployment automation

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions integration
   - Build status monitoring
   - Test automation integration
   - Pipeline visualization

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Lazy loading of project data
   - Caching strategies for GitHub operations
   - Optimized rendering for large project trees
   - Background synchronization

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failure modes for GitHub operations
   - Clear error messaging and recovery options
   - State persistence to prevent data loss
   - Offline capabilities where possible

3. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin architecture for future capabilities
   - Extension points for custom workflows
   - API for integration with other Tekton components
   - Customizable templates and workflows

## Implementation Guidelines

All implementation must follow the Clean Slate Architecture principles:

1. Use Athena as the gold standard reference for component structure
2. Maintain strict component isolation
3. Follow BEM naming convention for all CSS
4. Implement UI Manager and HTML Panel protection
5. Add comprehensive debug instrumentation
6. Test each step thoroughly before proceeding

## Conclusion

This phased development plan establishes a clear roadmap for Tekton Core, starting with essential project management capabilities in the current sprint and expanding to a comprehensive project orchestration system in future sprints.
