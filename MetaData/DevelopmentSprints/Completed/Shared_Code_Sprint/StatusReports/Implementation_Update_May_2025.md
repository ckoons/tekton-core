# Tekton Shared Code Sprint - Implementation Update (May 2025)

## Recent Accomplishments

This document summarizes the recent accomplishments in the Shared Code Sprint. The focus has been on:

1. Migrating component launch scripts to use tekton-register
2. Enhancing the LLM integration for key components
3. Documenting the implementation status

## Launch Script Migration

The following component launch scripts have been created or updated:

1. **Harmonia**:
   - Created `/Harmonia/run_harmonia.sh` using standardized pattern
   - Implemented tekton-register integration for registration
   - Added proper error handling and signal trapping
   - Configured to use port 8007 per the Single Port Architecture

2. **Athena**:
   - Created `/Athena/run_athena.sh` using standardized pattern
   - Implemented tekton-register integration for registration
   - Added proper error handling and signal trapping
   - Configured to use port 8005 per the Single Port Architecture

3. **Engram**:
   - Created `/Engram/run_engram.sh` using standardized pattern
   - Implemented tekton-register integration for registration
   - Added proper error handling and signal trapping
   - Configured to use port 8000 per the Single Port Architecture

## Configuration Files

1. **Component Configuration**:
   - Created `/config/components/engram.yaml` for Engram component registration
   - Documented capabilities including memory management and structured memory

## LLM Integration Enhancement

1. **Sophia LLM Integration**:
   - Updated `/Sophia/sophia/utils/llm_integration.py` to use enhanced tekton-llm-client features
   - Implemented PromptTemplateRegistry for template management
   - Added JSONParser for structured output parsing
   - Integrated StreamHandler for streaming responses
   - Implemented ClientSettings and LLMSettings for configuration
   - Created template loading from standard locations

2. **Template Directory Structure**:
   - Created `/Sophia/sophia/prompt_templates/` directory for storing prompt templates

## Documentation Updates

1. **Implementation Status**:
   - Updated `/SHARED_CODE_STATUS.md` with current migration status
   - Added component-by-component breakdown of migration progress
   - Documented next steps for completing the sprint

## Current Status

- **Component Registration Migration**: 8 of 12 components migrated
- **LLM Integration Enhancement**: 2 of 6 LLM-dependent components enhanced
- **Configuration Files**: Created for all components
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect current status

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration for remaining components:
   - Ergon
   - Synthesis
   - Terma
   - Codex

2. Enhance LLM integration for additional components:
   - Athena
   - Engram
   - Terma
   - Codex

3. Perform thorough testing of all migrated components

4. Prepare final PR for merging to main branch
