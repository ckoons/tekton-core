# Tekton Shared Code Implementation Sprint

## Overview

This sprint focuses on implementing shared code libraries and utilities across the Tekton ecosystem to eliminate code duplication, improve maintainability, and standardize patterns. The analysis has identified several areas where shared code can significantly improve the codebase.

## Implementation Tasks

You are tasked with implementing the shared utilities outlined in the Implementation Plan. Focus on these key areas:

1. **Shell Script Utilities** - Create shared bash utility libraries for the tekton-launch, tekton-status, and tekton-kill scripts
2. **Component Registration** - Create a standardized component registration system to replace individual register_with_hermes.py scripts
3. **LLM Integration** - Enhance tekton-llm-client with shared templates and utilities
4. **Core Utilities** - Implement shared libraries for configuration, logging, and error handling

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Create all shared utilities first, then update the components to use them
2. Don't worry about backward compatibility during the transition
3. Implement clean, well-documented code following Tekton's style guidelines
4. Include comprehensive docstrings and comments where appropriate
5. Add examples for how to use each utility

## Deliverables

1. **Shell Utilities**:
   - Create `scripts/lib/tekton-utils.sh` with core functions
   - Create `scripts/lib/tekton-ports.sh` for port management
   - Create `scripts/lib/tekton-process.sh` for process management
   - Create `scripts/bin/tekton-config-cli.py` as a Python bridge
   - Update tekton-launch, tekton-status, and tekton-kill to use shared libraries

2. **Component Registration**:
   - Create `tekton-core/tekton/utils/registration/` module
   - Implement YAML configuration format for component capabilities
   - Create `tekton-register` CLI tool
   - Update at least two components to use the new registration system

3. **LLM Integration**:
   - Enhance tekton-llm-client with prompt templates and response handlers
   - Create examples of how to use the enhanced client
   - Update at least one component to use the enhanced client

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update `MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DevelopmentGuides/SharedUtilities.md`
   - Update any other relevant documentation in `MetaData/TektonDocumentation/`
   - Follow the guidelines in `MetaData/TektonDocumentation/README.md`
   - Include examples for all new utilities

## Status Update Requirements

Upon completion, create a comprehensive status update in `MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Shared_Code_042825/StatusUpdate.md` that includes:

1. Summary of implemented changes
2. Description of created utilities and their usage
3. Components that were updated
4. Any challenges encountered
5. Recommendations for future improvements
6. Documentation that was updated

## Documentation Guidelines

Review the existing documentation in `MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DevelopmentGuides/` to understand the current standards and practices. Pay particular attention to:

1. `SharedUtilities.md` - Update this file with comprehensive information about the new shared utilities
2. Any other relevant guides that should reference the new shared code

Follow the documentation guidelines in `MetaData/TektonDocumentation/README.md` when updating documentation files.

## Implementation Prioritization

1. Start with shell utilities as they're self-contained and provide immediate benefits
2. Proceed with component registration system as it affects many components
3. Enhance LLM integration utilities
4. Update documentation throughout the process

## Getting Started

Begin by:

1. Reviewing the Implementation Plan in `MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Shared_Code_042825/ImplementationPlan.md`
2. Examining the current scripts and identifying duplication
3. Creating the shared utility libraries
4. Updating the scripts to use the shared libraries
5. Implementing the component registration system
6. Enhancing LLM integration utilities
7. Updating documentation
8. Providing a comprehensive status update
