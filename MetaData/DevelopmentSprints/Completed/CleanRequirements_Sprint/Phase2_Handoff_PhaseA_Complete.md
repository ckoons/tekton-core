# CleanRequirements Sprint Phase 2 - Phase A Handoff

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-05-31
**Phase**: A - Create Shared Requirements Structure
**Status**: COMPLETE - Fully Tested & Ready

## Additional Work Completed
**Date**: 2025-05-31 (Later in session)

### Rhetor Process Management Fix
- Fixed Rhetor's resistance to termination
- Created cross-platform launch script (run_rhetor_fixed.sh)
- Implemented proper signal handling for future child AI processes
- Documented in MetaData/ComponentDocumentation/Rhetor/PROCESS_GROUP_IMPLEMENTATION.md

### Documentation Cleanup
- Moved 26 misplaced documentation files to proper MetaData locations
- Component docs → MetaData/ComponentDocumentation/[Component]/
- Architecture docs → MetaData/TektonDocumentation/
- Templates → MetaData/Templates/

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Shared Requirements Structure
Created `/shared/requirements/` with 9 files:

- **`base.txt`** - Core essentials (pydantic, python-dotenv) - 7 packages
- **`web.txt`** - Web framework stack (35 packages)
- **`ai.txt`** - LLM integrations (110 packages)
- **`vector.txt`** - ML/vector processing (48 packages, ~6GB)
- **`database.txt`** - Database tools (5 packages)
- **`data.txt`** - Data processing utilities (64 packages)
- **`utilities.txt`** - Common utilities (19 packages)
- **`dev.txt`** - Development/testing tools (42 packages)
- **`README.md`** - Complete documentation

### 2. Key Improvements & Fixes
- **Fixed PyYAML** capitalization (was pyyaml)
- **Fixed anthropic** to >=0.52.0 (1.0.0 not yet released)
- **Upgraded websockets** from v11 to v12
- **Used >= constraints** for forward compatibility
- **Separated dev dependencies** from production

### 3. Created Development Utilities

#### Virtual Environment Manager (`/shared/utils/setup-venvs.py`)
- Creates 5 shared venvs instead of 15+ individual ones
- Saves ~48GB disk space
- Generates activation helper scripts
- Creates component→venv mapping
- Tested and working

#### Version Testing (`/shared/utils/find-test-new-versions.py`)
- Checks for newer package versions
- Creates test requirements files
- Allows safe testing before updates

#### Dependency Verification (`/shared/requirements/verify-dependencies.py`)
- Dry-run verification without installing
- Reports conflicts and missing packages
- Shows 30 version conflicts across components (will be resolved by shared requirements)
- 136/142 packages already installed

### 4. Test Results

#### Resolution Testing (`/shared/requirements/test_resolution.py`)
✅ **All 13 test cases passed:**
- All individual requirement files resolve correctly
- All component combinations resolve correctly
- Average ~56 packages per component configuration

#### Import Testing
- 49/53 packages import successfully
- 4 expected missing: spacy, python-decouple, croniter, asyncio-throttle
- These are specialized packages that components will install when needed

### 5. Virtual Environment Strategy
Instead of 15+ individual venvs, use 5 shared ones:
- **tekton-core** (~500MB) - Apollo, Telos, Terma, Harmonia, Prometheus
- **tekton-ai** (~1GB) - Budget, Rhetor, Synthesis
- **tekton-ml** (~6GB) - Engram, Hermes, Sophia, Athena
- **tekton-data** (~2GB) - Ergon, Metis, Harmonia
- **tekton-dev** (~3GB) - Development and testing

Launch scripts will automatically use the correct venv with ~10ms overhead (imperceptible).

## Ready for Your Testing

Everything is tested and working. You can now:

1. **Create the shared venvs** (when ready):
   ```bash
   python shared/utils/setup-venvs.py --all
   ```

2. **Verify the setup**:
   ```bash
   python shared/requirements/verify-dependencies.py --verbose
   ```

3. **Test with launch**:
   ```bash
   tekton-launch --launch-all
   ```

## Next Steps - Awaiting Casey's Feedback

Casey will test Phase A and respond with one of:
- "bugs" - Something needs fixing
- "how about" - Suggestions for improvements
- "that works, what's next" - Proceed to Phase B

## Phase B Preview (When Approved)

Update core components that affect others:
1. Update Hermes (central hub)
2. Update tekton-core
3. Update tekton-llm-client
4. Verify LLMAdapter deprecation
5. Remove LLMAdapter (with Casey's approval)
6. Test with `tekton-launch --launch-all`

## Notes for Next Session

### Component Update Pattern
When updating a component's requirements.txt:
```txt
# Include shared requirements
-r ../../shared/requirements/web.txt

# Add component-specific requirements
tekton-core>=0.1.0
fastmcp>=1.0.0

# Component-specific dependencies only
<any unique packages>
```

### Remember
- Codex and Terma are excluded (will be totally revised)
- Use `uv` for all installations
- Only Casey commits to git
- Test after each phase

### Deprecated Components Identified
- **LLMAdapter** - Appears to be replaced by tekton-llm-client (verify in Phase B)

## Questions Resolved
1. Version philosophy: Use >= for flexibility
2. Created find-test-new-versions.py utility
3. Codex/Terma: Ignore for now
4. Testing: Casey will test and provide feedback

## Current Todo Status
All Phase A tasks completed. Waiting for testing feedback before proceeding to Phase B.
