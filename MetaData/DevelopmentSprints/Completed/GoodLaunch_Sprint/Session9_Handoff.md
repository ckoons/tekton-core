# Session 9 Handoff - GoodLaunch Sprint

## Session Summary

Session 9 completed the unfinished work from Phase 2 (Hermes Registration) and made significant progress on Phase 3 (Python Launch System).

### What Was Completed

#### Phase 2: Component Registration and Communication (100% Complete) ‚úÖ

1. **Hermes Registration Implementation**
   - Implemented Hermes registration for 12 components:
     - Apollo, Prometheus, Telos, Metis, Harmonia, Ergon
     - Previously: Athena, Budget, Engram, Rhetor, Sophia, Synthesis
   - Updated Metis to use the common registration utility
   - Skipped Terma (will be rewritten) and Hephaestus (uses simple HTTP server)

2. **Fixed Registration Endpoints**
   - Updated `hermes_registration.py` to use correct endpoints:
     - `/api/register` (was `/api/components/register`)
     - `/api/heartbeat` (was `/api/components/heartbeat`) 
     - `/api/unregister` (was DELETE `/api/components/{name}`)

3. **Created Components Listing Endpoint**
   - Added `GET /api/components` to Hermes for listing registered components
   - Added `GET /api/components/{name}` for individual component info
   - Updated `tekton-status.py` to query Hermes for registration status

#### Phase 3: Python Launch System (75% Complete)

1. **Created `tekton-launch.py`** ‚úÖ
   - Full Python implementation replacing bash script
   - Features:
     - Parallel launching within priority groups
     - Automatic port checking and process killing
     - Interactive component selection
     - Cross-platform support (Windows/Unix)
     - Verbose logging
     - Uses centralized configuration

2. **Created `tekton-kill.py`** ‚úÖ
   - Graceful shutdown implementation
   - Features:
     - Attempts graceful shutdown via API first
     - Falls back to process termination
     - Kills components in reverse startup order
     - `--all-ports` flag to kill any process on Tekton ports
     - Cross-platform support

### Issues Encountered

1. **Permission Issues with psutil**
   - The scripts encounter "Access denied" errors when checking ports
   - This is likely a macOS security restriction
   - May need to run with elevated privileges or find alternative approach

2. **Component Launch Paths**
   - The launch script needs refinement for finding component directories
   - Some components have non-standard directory names (e.g., LLMAdapter)

## Next Session Tasks

### Phase 3: Python Launch System (Remaining 25%)
1. **Debug and fix the launch/kill scripts**
   - Resolve permission issues with port checking
   - Fix component directory resolution
   - Test launching all components
   - Verify scripts work from any directory

### Phase 4: Parallel Launch Implementation
1. **Optimize startup sequence**
   - Implement dependency-based launching
   - Measure startup time improvements
   - Target 50% reduction in total startup time

### Phase 5: UI Status Integration
1. **Add status dots to Hephaestus**
   - Update navigation tabs with component status
   - Implement WebSocket or polling for updates
   - Show registration status from Hermes

## Technical Details for Next Session

### Launch Script Issues to Fix

1. **Port checking permission errors**
   ```python
   # Current approach uses psutil.net_connections()
   # May need to use lsof command or try/except around socket binding
   ```

2. **Component directory mapping**
   ```python
   # Need to handle special cases better:
   component_dirs = {
       "llm_adapter": "LLMAdapter",
       "tekton_core": "tekton-core",
       # etc.
   }
   ```

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Launch single component
- [ ] Launch multiple components with dependencies
- [ ] Launch all components
- [ ] Kill single component
- [ ] Kill all components
- [ ] Test from different directories
- [ ] Test on Windows (if available)

## Code Locations

- **Launch Script**: `/scripts/tekton-launch.py`
- **Kill Script**: `/scripts/tekton-kill.py`
- **Status Script**: `/scripts/tekton-status.py` (updated with Hermes integration)
- **Registration Utility**: `/shared/utils/hermes_registration.py` (fixed endpoints)
- **Hermes Endpoints**: `/Hermes/hermes/api/endpoints.py` (added components listing)

## Sprint Progress

- Phase 1: ‚úÖ 100% Complete
- Phase 2: ‚úÖ 100% Complete  
- Phase 3: üîÑ 75% Complete
- Phase 4: ‚è≥ 0% Complete
- Phase 5: ‚è≥ 0% Complete

Overall Sprint Progress: ~55% Complete

The sprint is making good progress. The foundation work (import fixes, health endpoints, registration) is complete. The launch system is implemented but needs debugging. Once the scripts are working, parallel launch and UI integration should be straightforward.
