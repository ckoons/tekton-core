# MCP Unified Integration Sprint

This directory contains the documentation and planning artifacts for the MCP Unified Integration Sprint, which consolidates the previously planned FastMCP_Sprint and MCP_Integration_Sprint into a comprehensive approach to MCP implementation in Tekton.

## Overview

The MCP Unified Integration Sprint focuses on creating a robust, standardized MCP implementation across all Tekton components. It addresses current issues with component registration, service initialization, and request routing while establishing a foundation for integrating external MCP servers like open-mcp and pluggedin-mcp-proxy.

## Key Documents

- [Sprint Plan](./SprintPlan.md): High-level overview of the sprint goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](./ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions made for this sprint
- [Implementation Plan](./ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed implementation plan with tasks and phases
- [ClaudeCodePrompt.md](./ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Working Claude sessions

## Related Sprints

This sprint supersedes the following previously planned sprints:

- [FastMCP_Sprint](../Superceeded/FastMCP_Sprint): Focused on integrating the FastMCP library
- [MCP_Integration_Sprint](../Superceeded/MCP_Integration_Sprint): Focused on implementing MCP across components

## Sprint Branches

All development for this sprint should be conducted on the branch:

```
sprint/mcp-unified-integration-250507
```

Working Claude sessions must verify they are on the correct branch before making any changes using:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/mcp-unified-integration-250507
```

## Status and Updates

Status reports and updates will be added to the [StatusReports](./StatusReports) directory as the sprint progresses.

## External Project Integration

This sprint prepares Tekton for integration with the following external projects:

1. **open-mcp**: Standardized approach to converting web APIs into MCP servers
2. **pluggedin-mcp-proxy**: Proxy server for aggregating multiple MCP servers
3. **pipedream**: Event-driven integration platform

While actual integration with these projects is out of scope for this sprint, the architectural foundations and patterns for such integration will be established.

## Next Steps

After completing this sprint, the following initiatives are recommended:

1. **MCP Server Discovery** (formerly MCPDiscoveryIntegration): Implementing comprehensive discovery capabilities for MCP servers
2. **External MCP Integration**: Specific integrations with external MCP projects
3. **UI/UX Enhancements**: Updating user interfaces to leverage the new MCP capabilities
