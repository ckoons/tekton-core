# Tekton Launch Testing - Continuation Prompt

## Project Context

You're assisting with testing and fixing the Tekton component launch system. We've been methodically testing the launch process for each component, identifying issues, and fixing them one by one.

## Previous Work Completed

1. **Scripts Fixed**:
   - `tekton-kill`: Modified to exclude Claude processes from termination
   - `tekton-status`: Enhanced to properly detect Hermes and other processes

2. **Components Fixed**:
   - **Hermes**: Fixed async methods in MessageBus class, added stub database MCP script, fixed import errors
   - **Engram**: Successfully launches with fallback mode

3. **Documentation Created**:
   - `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Launch_Testing_Sprint/LAUNCH_TESTING_PLAN.md`
   - `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Launch_Testing_Sprint/COMPONENT_ISSUES.md`
   - `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Launch_Testing_Sprint/FASTMCP_NOTES.md`
   - `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Launch_Testing_Sprint/RHETOR_DIAGNOSIS.md`
   - `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Launch_Testing_Sprint/LAUNCH_TESTING_SUMMARY.md`

## Current Issues in Priority Order

1. **Component Directory Variable Issue**:
   - In `tekton_start_component_server` function (in `/scripts/lib/tekton-process.sh`)
   - Error: `name 'component_dir' is not defined`
   - Problem: Variable not properly passed to nested Python subprocess
   - Priority: High - Blocking Rhetor and potentially other components

2. **Rhetor Method Missing**:
   - Error: `'PromptTemplateRegistry' object has no attribute 'load_from_directory'`
   - Occurs during Rhetor startup in `llm_client.py`
   - Priority: High - Blocking Rhetor functionality

3. **Port Standardization**:
   - Rhetor attempts to use port 8003 but logs show it running on 8300
   - Need to standardize port usage across components
   - Priority: Medium - Affects component discovery

## Next Steps

1. Rewrite the component launch mechanism to properly pass variables to subprocesses
2. Fix the missing method in Rhetor's PromptTemplateRegistry
3. Continue testing with the next components in sequence (Ergon, Prometheus, etc.)
4. Update documentation with new findings

## Testing Workflow

We're following the methodology outlined in `LAUNCH_TESTING_PLAN.md`, testing components one by one and documenting issues as we go. The approach is collaborative, methodical, and focuses on fixing issues in priority order.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Check component status
/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/scripts/tekton-status

# Stop components
/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/scripts/tekton-kill

# Launch specific component
/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/scripts/tekton-launch --components <component> --no-ui --non-interactive

# View logs
cat $HOME/.tekton/logs/<component>.log
```

## Important Files

- Main launch script: `/scripts/tekton-launch`
- Process utilities: `/scripts/lib/tekton-process.sh`
- Port configurations: `/scripts/lib/tekton-ports.sh`
- Rhetor app: `/Rhetor/rhetor/api/app.py`
- Rhetor client: `/Rhetor/rhetor/core/llm_client.py`

## Development Context

The upcoming FastMCP Development Sprint will address issues found during this testing. We're creating temporary workarounds where necessary and documenting them for proper implementation during the sprint.
