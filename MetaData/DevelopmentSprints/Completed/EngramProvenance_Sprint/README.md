# Engram Provenance Sprint

## Overview
Implementing git-like provenance tracking for AI memories in Engram, enabling transparent collaborative cognition.

## Sprint Goals
1. Add provenance tracking to memory storage
2. Implement branching for memory versions
3. Add transparent editing history
4. Enable memory forking and merging
5. Create retrieval options for viewing edit history

## Key Features
- **Provenance Chain**: Track who touched a memory and how
- **Branching**: Maintain multiple versions of memories
- **Transparency**: See full edit history
- **Attribution**: Credit insights to their creators
- **Consent**: Choose which edits to accept
