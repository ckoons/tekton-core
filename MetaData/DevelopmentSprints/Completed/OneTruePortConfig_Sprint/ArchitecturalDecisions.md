# Architectural Decisions - OneTruePortConfig Sprint

## Overview
This document outlines the key architectural decisions for centralizing port configuration in Tekton. These decisions provide direction while allowing flexibility in implementation approach.

## Decision 1: Centralized Port Authority

### Context
Port configuration is currently scattered across env_config.py, env_manager.py, component files, and .env files. This creates maintenance challenges and inconsistencies.

### Decision
Create a central port configuration system that serves as the single source of truth for all port assignments and access patterns.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Status Quo**: Continue with distributed configuration
   - Pros: No migration needed
   - Cons: Ongoing maintenance issues, error-prone

2. **Database-Driven**: Store ports in a central database
   - Pros: Dynamic updates possible
   - Cons: Additional dependency, complexity

3. **File-Based Central Config**: Single configuration file/module
   - Pros: Simple, versionable, no new dependencies
   - Cons: Requires restart for changes

### Implications
- All components must migrate to new system
- Need backwards compatibility during transition
- Clear patterns for new components

## Decision 2: Service Discovery Pattern

### Context
Components currently hardcode other component ports when making cross-component calls, creating tight coupling.

### Decision
Implement a service discovery pattern where components can dynamically discover other component endpoints.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Hardcoded URLs**: Current approach
   - Pros: Simple, explicit
   - Cons: Fragile, maintenance burden

2. **DNS-Based**: Use DNS for service discovery
   - Pros: Industry standard
   - Cons: Complexity for local development

3. **Registry-Based**: Central registry with component locations
   - Pros: Flexible, supports health checks
   - Cons: Additional component to maintain

### Implications
- Components need new utilities for discovering peers
- May leverage existing Hermes registry
- Must work in both local and deployed environments

## Decision 3: Configuration Loading Strategy

### Context
Need to determine when and how port configurations are loaded and validated.

### Decision
Load port configuration at startup with validation, fail fast if configuration is invalid.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load ports when first accessed
   - Pros: Faster startup
   - Cons: Runtime failures possible

2. **Hot Reload**: Support changing ports without restart
   - Pros: Zero downtime updates
   - Cons: Complex implementation

3. **Startup Validation**: Validate all ports at startup
   - Pros: Fail fast, predictable
   - Cons: Slightly slower startup

### Implications
- Clear error messages for misconfiguration
- Validation of port ranges and conflicts
- Startup sequence may need adjustment

## Decision 4: Migration Strategy

### Context
Need to migrate all components without breaking existing deployments.

### Decision
Implement a phased migration with backwards compatibility layer.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Big Bang**: Change everything at once
   - Pros: Clean, no transition period
   - Cons: High risk, potential downtime

2. **Component by Component**: Gradual migration
   - Pros: Lower risk, can rollback
   - Cons: Longer transition period

3. **Dual Support**: Support both patterns temporarily
   - Pros: Smooth transition
   - Cons: Temporary complexity

### Implications
- Need compatibility layer during transition
- Clear timeline for deprecation
- Testing both old and new patterns

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance
- Configuration loaded once at startup
- No runtime lookups for ports
- Service discovery caching

### Security
- No ports in code repository
- Environment-based configuration
- Validation of port ranges

### Maintainability
- Single place to update ports
- Clear patterns for new components
- Self-documenting configuration

### Testing
- Mock configuration for tests
- Test utilities for port setup
- Integration tests for service discovery

## Future Considerations
- Dynamic port allocation for scaling
- Support for multiple instances of components
- Integration with container orchestration
- Health check endpoints standardization

## Notes for Implementation
The implementing Claude should evaluate these decisions and propose specific implementation details. The key is achieving centralization while maintaining system reliability.
