# Logging Clarity Sprint

## Overview

The Logging Clarity Sprint focuses on implementing a standardized, configurable logging system for the Tekton ecosystem. This sprint aims to improve debugging, diagnostics, and observability while providing better control over log verbosity.

## Sprint Documents

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md) - High-level overview of the sprint goals and approach
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md) - Key decisions about the logging system design
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md) - Detailed plan for implementing the logging system
- [Logger API Design](LoggerAPIDesign.md) - Detailed specification of the logger module interface

## Current Status

This sprint is currently in the planning phase. Initial documentation has been created, but implementation has not yet begun. The sprint is intended to be executed in coordination with the Clean Slate Sprint, with initial implementation focused on new UI components.

## Key Decisions

1. Create a centralized `logger.js` module for consistent logging
2. Support multiple log levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, OFF)
3. Allow both global and component-specific log level configuration
4. Integrate with Settings component for UI-based control
5. Support environment variable configuration for deployment settings
6. Implement the system for incremental adoption without requiring full codebase refactoring

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach:

1. First, create the core logger module and environment integration
2. Then, add Settings UI integration for user control
3. Finally, integrate with components incrementally, starting with new components
4. Apply to existing components as part of regular maintenance

## Notes for Implementation

- Focus on non-breaking changes that allow gradual adoption
- Prioritize developer experience and ease of use
- Ensure minimal performance impact, especially when logs are disabled
- Design for compatibility with existing patterns where possible

## Coordination with Clean Slate Sprint

This sprint will coordinate with the Clean Slate Sprint as follows:

1. Setup the logging infrastructure and documentation as part of this sprint
2. Apply the logging patterns to new UI components as they are developed in the Clean Slate Sprint
3. Update existing components incrementally rather than requiring a full refactoring

## Next Steps

1. Complete detailed API design
2. Develop the core logger module
3. Integrate with Settings component
4. Update component templates
5. Apply to Ergon and Athena components as proofs of concept
