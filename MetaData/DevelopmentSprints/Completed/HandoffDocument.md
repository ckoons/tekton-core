## Implementation Details

### FastMCP Integration

The FastMCP integration in tekton-core provides a decorator-based approach to defining MCP tools, capabilities, processors, and contexts. The implementation consists of:

1. **Decorators (`decorators.py`)**
   - `@mcp_tool`: Decorator for defining tools
   - `@mcp_capability`: Decorator for defining capabilities
   - `@mcp_processor`: Decorator for defining processors
   - `@mcp_context`: Decorator for defining context handlers

2. **Adapters (`adapters.py`)**
   - `adapt_tool`: Adapter for existing tool specifications
   - `adapt_processor`: Adapter for existing processor specifications
   - `adapt_context`: Adapter for existing contexts
   - `adapt_legacy_registry`: Adapter for legacy tool registries

3. **Schema (`schema.py`)**
   - `ToolSchema`: Schema for MCP tools
   - `ProcessorSchema`: Schema for MCP processors
   - `CapabilitySchema`: Schema for MCP capabilities
   - `ContextSchema`: Schema for MCP contexts
   - `MessageSchema`: Schema for MCP messages
   - `ResponseSchema`: Schema for MCP responses
   - `ContentSchema`: Schema for MCP content items

4. **Client (`client.py`)**
   - `MCPClient`: Client for interacting with MCP services
   - `register_component`: Utility for registering components
   - `execute_tool`: Utility for executing tools
   - `get_capabilities`: Utility for getting capabilities

### Example Usage

See `examples.py` for examples of how to use the FastMCP integration:

```python
@mcp_tool(
    name="HelloWorld",
    description="A simple hello world tool",
    tags=["example", "greeting"],
    category="demo"
)
async def hello_world(name: str = "World") -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Say hello to the specified name.
    
    Args:
        name: Name to greet
        
    Returns:
        Greeting message
    """
    return {
        "message": f"Hello, {name}!"
    }
```

## Budget Component FastMCP Implementation Plan

The Budget component has an existing MCP implementation that needs to be updated to use FastMCP. Here's the detailed plan:

### Step 1: Add FastMCP as a dependency
Update Budget's setup.py to add tekton-core as a dependency, which includes FastMCP.

### Step 2: Create Budget MCP Module
Create a new MCP module with tool definitions:
```
budget/
  core/
    mcp/
      __init__.py
      tools.py  # Define FastMCP tools
```

Define FastMCP tools for Budget's existing functionality:
- allocate_tokens
- check_budget
- record_usage
- get_budget_status
- get_model_recommendations
- route_with_budget_awareness
- get_usage_analytics

### Step 3: Update API Integration
1. Create a new FastMCP router in the existing mcp_endpoints.py file
2. Add FastMCP standard endpoints:
   - `/mcp/health`
   - `/mcp/capabilities`
   - `/mcp/tools`
   - `/mcp/process`
3. Keep the existing MCP endpoints for backward compatibility

### Step 4: Implement Core Functionality
1. Add decorators to existing message handler functions:
   - `@mcp_tool` for each message handler
   - `@mcp_capability` to group related tools
2. Create tool registry and registration functions
3. Update core engine and allocation manager to use FastMCP

### Step 5: Leverage Shared Utilities
1. Use `endpoints.py` from shared utilities for router creation
2. Use `tooling.py` for tool registration
3. Use `requests.py` and `response.py` for standardized processing

## Implementation Notes for Budget Component

### Existing MCP Endpoints
The Budget component already has a comprehensive MCP implementation with:
- `/api/mcp/message` endpoint for handling MCP messages
- Message handlers for different message types
- Custom MCPRequest and MCPResponse models

### Approach for Budget
1. Keep the existing MCP implementation for backward compatibility
2. Add a parallel FastMCP implementation
3. Gradually migrate functionality to FastMCP
4. Eventually deprecate the custom implementation

### Example Tool Definition
Example for allocate_tokens:

```python
@mcp_capability(
    name="budget_management",
    description="Capability for token budget management",
    modality="resource"
)
@mcp_tool(
    name="AllocateBudget",
    description="Allocate token budget for a task",
    tags=["budget", "allocation"],
    category="budget"
)
async def allocate_budget(
    context_id: str,
    amount: int,
    component: str,
    tier: Optional[str] = None,
    provider: Optional[str] = None,
    model: Optional[str] = None,
    task_type: str = "default",
    priority: int = 5,
    allocation_manager: Optional[Any] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Handle a budget allocation request.
    
    Args:
        context_id: Context ID for this allocation
        amount: Number of tokens to allocate
        component: Component requesting allocation
        tier: Optional budget tier
        provider: Optional provider name
        model: Optional model name
        task_type: Type of task for this allocation
        priority: Priority of this allocation
        allocation_manager: Allocation manager (injected)
        
    Returns:
        Allocation result
    """
    if not allocation_manager:
        return {
            "error": "Allocation manager not provided"
        }
        
    try:
        # Convert string tier to enum if provided
        if isinstance(tier, str) and tier:
            tier = apollo_adapter.tier_mapping.get(tier.lower(), BudgetTier.REMOTE_HEAVYWEIGHT)
        
        # Allocate tokens
        allocation = allocation_manager.allocate_budget(
            context_id=context_id,
            component=component,
            tokens=amount,
            tier=tier,
            provider=provider,
            model=model,
            task_type=task_type,
            priority=priority
        )
        
        return {
            "allocation_id": allocation.allocation_id,
            "context_id": allocation.context_id,
            "amount": allocation.tokens_allocated,
            "remaining": allocation.remaining_tokens,
            "tier": tier.value if isinstance(tier, BudgetTier) else tier,
            "provider": provider,
            "model": model
        }
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error allocating tokens: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "error": f"Error allocating tokens: {str(e)}",
            "context_id": context_id,
            "amount": 0,
            "remaining": 0
        }
```

4. Implement error handling and retries

### 4. Create External Integration Patterns

Create patterns for integrating with external MCP servers:

1. Create adapters for external MCP servers
2. Implement security sandboxing
3. Implement capability aggregation and conflict resolution

### 5. Ensure Claude Code Compatibility

Finally, ensure MCP implementation is compatible with Claude Code:

1. Create Claude Code MCP client
2. Implement tool exposure to Claude Code
3. Test Claude Code integration

## Conclusion

The MCP Unified Integration Sprint is making good progress. The core FastMCP integration has been implemented in tekton-core, shared MCP utilities have been created, and several components (Hermes, Apollo, and Athena) have been updated to use the FastMCP approach. 

The implementation provides a more elegant, decorator-based approach to MCP that reduces boilerplate code and improves developer experience. The adapters allow for a smooth transition from the existing implementation to the new approach, and the schema validation ensures consistent message formats.

The next component to update is Budget, which has an existing custom MCP implementation that needs to be adapted to use FastMCP while maintaining backward compatibility. After that, the remaining components will be updated in a systematic, methodical manner.

The shared MCP utilities created as part of this sprint are significantly simplifying the implementation across components, providing standardized endpoints, tool registration, and request/response handling.

Continue with the next steps as outlined above to complete the MCP Unified Integration Sprint.
