# YetAnotherMCP Sprint - Phase 3 Complete

## Summary

Phase 3 has been successfully completed. All high-priority components (Athena, Budget, and Engram) now bridge their FastMCP tools with Hermes while maintaining their existing implementations.

## What Was Done

### 1. Athena Migration ✅
- Created `/Athena/athena/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
- Bridges Athena's 10 FastMCP tools with Hermes
- Updated `app.py` to initialize the bridge on startup
- Added proper cleanup on shutdown
- Maintains existing FastMCP functionality

### 2. Budget Migration ✅
- Created `/Budget/budget/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
- Bridges Budget's 7 FastMCP tools with Hermes
- Updated `app.py` to initialize the bridge on startup
- Added proper cleanup on shutdown
- Maintains existing FastMCP functionality

### 3. Engram Integration ✅
- Confirmed Engram already has Hermes registration in `server.py`
- Created `/Engram/engram/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
- Bridges Engram's memory tools with Hermes
- Updated `server.py` to initialize the bridge
- Added proper cleanup on shutdown

## Key Implementation Details

### Hybrid Approach
As recommended in the handoff, we kept FastMCP implementations intact and added a bridge layer that:
1. Loads FastMCP tools from each component
2. Wraps them with Hermes-compatible handlers
3. Registers them with Hermes using the shared MCP client
4. Maintains backward compatibility

### Bridge Pattern
Each component now has a `hermes_bridge.py` that:
```python
class ComponentMCPBridge(MCPService):
    - Initializes with component's engine/manager
    - Loads FastMCP tools
    - Registers standard tools (health, info)
    - Registers FastMCP tools with Hermes
    - Handles cleanup on shutdown
```

### Integration Points
1. **Startup**: Bridge initializes after Hermes registration
2. **Tool Registration**: Each tool gets prefixed with component name (e.g., `athena.SearchEntities`)
3. **Execution**: Hermes delegates to FastMCP handlers
4. **Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and unregistration

## Testing

Created `/tests/test_mcp_phase3_migration.py` that:
1. Checks all components are healthy
2. Verifies tools are registered with Hermes
3. Tests tool execution through Hermes
4. Validates the hybrid approach works

## Next Steps

### Medium Priority Components
- **Rhetor**: Implement full MCP service
- **Sophia**: Create MCP implementation
- **Synthesis**: Add basic MCP support

### Low Priority Components
- Apollo, Ergon, Harmonia, Metis, Prometheus, Telos
- Add basic MCP with standard tools

### Recommendations
1. Run the test script to verify everything works
2. Monitor logs for any registration issues
3. Consider adding more sophisticated error handling
4. Document the hybrid pattern for future components
