# ByeByeNumPy Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the ByeByeNumPy Development Sprint. This sprint focuses on eliminating NumPy/SciPy dependencies from Tekton components to resolve compatibility issues and improve system reliability.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on dependency optimization and compatibility resolution across core components.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Eliminate NumPy Compatibility Issues**: Remove NumPy 1.x/2.x compatibility conflicts causing component crashes
2. **Reduce System Dependencies**: Simplify the dependency tree by removing unnecessary ML libraries
3. **Improve Startup Reliability**: Enable components to start without ML library loading overhead
4. **Maintain Functionality**: Preserve all current functionality while switching to simpler implementations

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Resolving Critical Launch Failures**: Fixes NumPy compatibility crashes preventing system startup
- **Reducing Complexity**: Eliminates heavy ML dependencies from components that don't need them
- **Improving Performance**: Faster component startup times without ML library initialization
- **Enhancing Maintainability**: Fewer dependencies means easier maintenance and fewer compatibility issues
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Reduced memory footprint in non-ML components

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Current Tekton components have the following NumPy/ML dependencies:

- **Ergon**: Uses NumPy and sentence-transformers for embedding operations
- **Apollo**: Uses NumPy and SciPy for statistical analysis and prediction models
- **Hermes**: Has sentence-transformers dependency but minimal usage
- **Multiple Components**: Various components include ML libraries but don't actively use them

### Pain Points

- **NumPy Version Conflicts**: NumPy 2.x is installed but components use libraries compiled against NumPy 1.x
- **Failed Component Launches**: Ergon and Apollo crash on startup due to scipy/transformers import failures
- **Unnecessary Dependencies**: Many components include ML libraries they don't actually need
- **Slow Startup Times**: ML library initialization adds overhead to component startup
- **Memory Overhead**: Unused ML libraries consume memory in non-ML components

## Proposed Approach

The approach is to systematically eliminate NumPy dependencies by replacing ML functionality with simpler alternatives:

### Key Components Affected

- **Ergon**: Remove sentence-transformers, delegate embedding to Engram or use OpenAI API
- **Apollo**: Replace SciPy statistical functions with pure Python implementations
- **Hermes**: Remove unused sentence-transformers dependency
- **Requirements Files**: Clean up ML dependencies from components that don't need them

### Technical Approach

1. **Analysis Phase**: Identify actual vs. declared NumPy usage across components
2. **Replacement Strategy**: Replace ML functionality with:
   - OpenAI API calls for embeddings (Ergon)
   - Pure Python statistical functions (Apollo)
   - Delegation to dedicated ML components (Sophia, Engram)
3. **Dependency Cleanup**: Remove unused ML libraries from requirements.txt files
4. **Interface Preservation**: Maintain same APIs while changing underlying implementations
5. **Fallback Implementation**: Provide graceful degradation when external services unavailable

## Code Quality Requirements

All changes must follow Tekton's established quality standards:

### Debug Instrumentation
- All modified functions must include appropriate debug logging
- Error handling must provide clear feedback about functionality changes
- Performance metrics should be captured for before/after comparison

### Testing Requirements
- Existing functionality must be preserved
- New implementations must have equivalent test coverage
- Integration tests must verify component interactions still work

### Documentation
- All API changes must be documented
- Migration notes for any behavior changes
- Performance impact documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Functionality Loss**: Some advanced ML features might be simplified
2. **Performance Changes**: Alternative implementations may have different performance characteristics
3. **API Changes**: Some internal APIs may need modification

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Change one component at a time
2. **Fallback Options**: Maintain ability to re-enable ML dependencies if needed
3. **Thorough Testing**: Comprehensive testing at each step to ensure functionality preservation

## Success Criteria

Sprint is successful when:

1. **All Components Start**: `tekton-launch --launch-all` completes without NumPy errors
2. **Functionality Preserved**: All existing features work as before
3. **Dependencies Reduced**: NumPy/SciPy removed from components that don't need them
4. **Performance Improved**: Faster startup times for affected components
5. **Maintainability Enhanced**: Simpler dependency management going forward

## Timeline

This sprint is designed for single-session implementation with potential for follow-up sessions if needed.

**Phase 1 (Primary)**: Core dependency elimination and implementation
**Phase 2 (Optional)**: Performance optimization and advanced testing

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Current branch: `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125` (reusing for this work)
- All MCP and port assignment fixes from current session completed
- Access to OpenAI API for embedding fallback (if needed)
- Understanding of current component functionality and APIs
