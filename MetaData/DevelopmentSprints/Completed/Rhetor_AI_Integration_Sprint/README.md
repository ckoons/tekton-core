# Rhetor AI Integration Sprint

## Overview

This sprint implements dedicated AI instances for each Tekton component, managed by Rhetor, with intelligent model selection, prompt engineering, and integration with Hephaestus UI chat interfaces.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Component AI Management**: Each Tekton component gets a dedicated AI assistant
2. **Intelligent Model Selection**: Optimal model assignment based on component needs
3. **Prompt Engineering Pipeline**: Transparent enhancement of prompts and responses
4. **Team Chat**: AI-to-AI and AI-to-human collaboration channel

## Key Features

### Component-Specific AIs
- Budget AI: Financial analysis with Claude 3 Haiku (fast, efficient)
- Athena AI: Knowledge management with Claude 3 Sonnet
- Sophia AI: Research and learning with Claude 3 Opus
- Ergon AI: Code generation with GPT-4
- And more...

### Filter System
- **Prompt Filters**: Enhance user prompts with component context
- **Response Filters**: Format AI responses for component consumption
- **Transparent**: Components don't need to know about filtering

### Team Chat
- All component AIs can communicate in a shared channel
- Rhetor moderates the conversation
- Human can participate and guide the discussion
- Automatic summarization and action extraction

## Implementation Status

- [x] Phase 1: Component AI Management ✅
- [x] Phase 2: Prompt Engineering and Protocols ✅
- [x] Phase 3: MCP Tools Integration ✅
- [x] Phase 4A: Real-Time Streaming Support (SSE) ✅
- [ ] Phase 4B: Dynamic Specialist Creation 🎯 Next
- [ ] Optional_Rhetor_Sprint: Deferred features

## Quick Start

Once implemented, each component will automatically have its AI assistant available:

```javascript
// In any component's initialization
const chatInterface = createChatInterface(container, {
    componentId: 'budget',
    useComponentAI: true  // Enable component-specific AI
});
```
