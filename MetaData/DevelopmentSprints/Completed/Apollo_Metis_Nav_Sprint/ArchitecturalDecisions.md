# Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint - Architectural Decisions

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for the Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint. It captures the reasoning behind design choices and establishes guidelines for implementation.

## 1. Navigation Tab Positioning

### Decision
- Position the Apollo tab between Engram and Rhetor in the LEFT PANEL navigation
- Position the Metis tab between Ergon and Harmonia in the LEFT PANEL navigation

### Rationale
- Apollo focuses on attention and prediction, which conceptually fits between memory (Engram) and LLM interfaces (Rhetor)
- Metis focuses on workflow, which logically sits between agent coordination (Ergon) and orchestration (Harmonia)
- This positioning follows Tekton's architectural organization from infrastructure to application layers

### Implementation Guidelines
- The tab order must be precisely maintained to ensure logical component relationships
- Navigation insertion should be done by position index rather than by relying on component names

## 2. Color Selection

### Decision
- Assign #FFD600 (Amber/Golden Yellow) as the color indicator for Apollo
- Assign #00BFA5 (Mint/Turquoise) as the color indicator for Metis

### Rationale
- Apollo's golden yellow color reflects its role with attention (spotlight) and prediction (golden future path)
- Metis's mint/turquoise color bridges the teal of Ergon and orange of Harmonia, matching its workflow bridging role
- Both colors are visually distinct from all existing component colors
- Colors maintain the overall harmonious palette of the Tekton UI

### Implementation Guidelines
- Add color definitions to the component-specific styles section in index.html
- Follow the same CSS pattern as existing color indicators
- Test for visual distinctiveness in both light and dark themes

## 3. UI Space Management

### Decision
- Reduce the height of all navigation tabs by approximately 6%
- Reduce vertical padding on the LEFT PANEL navigation list
- Maintain the same horizontal proportions for all tabs

### Rationale
- Adding two more tabs risks exceeding the vertical space available on standard displays
- Proportional height reduction maintains visual harmony while accommodating more tabs
- Reducing only the vertical dimensions preserves readability and interaction targets

### Implementation Guidelines
- Adjust the `.nav-item` CSS class to reduce height
- Reduce padding on the `.component-nav` container
- Ensure all text remains fully visible and tabs remain easily clickable

## 4. Component Preparation Approach

### Decision
- Add navigation tabs now, without implementing actual component functionality
- Prepare placeholder HTML structures for future implementation
- Follow the Clean Slate component architecture patterns

### Rationale
- Navigation tabs establish the UI framework for future development
- Placeholder structures ensure consistent integration paths for future implementations
- Maintaining the Clean Slate architecture ensures component isolation and reliability

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create minimal component structure files for both components
- Follow the established component loading patterns
- Prepare for future implementation by establishing clear interfaces

## 5. CSS Modification Strategy

### Decision
- Modify only the specific CSS classes needed for navigation tabs
- Keep changes isolated to minimize risk to other components
- Use consistent BEM naming conventions for any new CSS classes

### Rationale
- Targeted CSS changes reduce the risk of unintended side effects
- BEM naming ensures clear ownership and prevents style leakage
- Consistency with existing patterns makes future maintenance easier

### Implementation Guidelines
- Focus changes on `.nav-item`, `.component-nav`, and color indicator styles
- Test changes thoroughly to ensure no visual regressions in other areas
- Document any new CSS patterns or modifications

## 6. Extensibility Planning

### Decision
- Design with consideration for potential future tab additions
- Implement a solution that can scale beyond the current number of components
- Consider responsive design principles for various screen sizes

### Rationale
- Tekton is an evolving system likely to add more components over time
- A scalable design now prevents future rework
- Responsive design ensures usability across different environments

### Implementation Guidelines
- Avoid hard-coded assumptions about the number of navigation items
- Use relative sizing to accommodate varying numbers of tabs
- Consider future enhancements like tab grouping or collapsible sections

## 7. Documentation Approach

### Decision
- Create comprehensive sprint documentation following the established pattern
- Document UI changes in both user-facing and developer documentation
- Update component registry to include the new components

### Rationale
- Consistent documentation ensures knowledge transfer
- UI changes should be reflected in both user guides and technical documentation
- Registry updates prepare for future component implementation

### Implementation Guidelines
- Create all standard sprint documentation artifacts
- Update relevant UI documentation to reflect new navigation options
- Ensure component registry includes placeholders for the new components
