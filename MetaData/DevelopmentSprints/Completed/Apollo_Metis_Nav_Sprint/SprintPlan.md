# Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes for adding two new navigation tabs to the Tekton UI LEFT PANEL while ensuring UI integrity and space management.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on extending the navigation system to include two new components while maintaining UI usability.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Add Apollo Navigation Tab**: Add a new 'Apollo - Attention/Prediction' tab between Engram and Rhetor
2. **Add Metis Navigation Tab**: Add a new 'Metis - Workflow' tab between Ergon and Harmonia
3. **Adjust UI Space**: Optimize LEFT PANEL navigation bar spacing to accommodate all tabs
4. **Maintain UI Consistency**: Ensure new tabs follow established design patterns and color schemes

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Expanding Tekton's Capabilities**: Providing UI access points for new AI orchestration components
- **Improving Navigation**: Making the system's functional organization more clear and logical
- **Enhancing Usability**: Maintaining UI integrity despite increasing complexity
- **Supporting Future Development**: Enabling future implementation of Apollo and Metis components

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The current UI implementation has a LEFT PANEL with the following navigation tabs (in order):

1. Tekton - Projects (#FBBC05 - Yellow/Gold)
2. Prometheus - Planning (#C2185B - Pink)
3. Telos - Requirements (#00796B - Dark Teal)
4. Ergon - Agents/Tools/MCP (#0097A7 - Teal)
5. Harmonia - Orchestration (#F57C00 - Orange)
6. Synthesis - Integration (#3949AB - Indigo)
7. Athena - Knowledge (#7B1FA2 - Purple)
8. Sophia - Learning (#7CB342 - Light Green)
9. Engram - Memory (#34A853 - Green)
10. Rhetor - LLM/Prompt/Context (#D32F2F - Red)
11. Hermes - Messages/Data (#4285F4 - Blue)
12. Codex - Coding (#00ACC1 - Light Blue)
13. Terma - Terminal (#5D4037 - Brown)

The LEFT PANEL navigation area is approaching capacity, and adding two more tabs without adjustments could create usability issues.

### Pain Points

1. **Space Constraints**: The LEFT PANEL has limited vertical space for navigation tabs
2. **Visual Density**: Adding more tabs without adjustments could make the UI cluttered
3. **Color Differentiation**: Need to ensure new tab colors are distinct from existing ones
4. **Tab Positioning**: Need to precisely position new tabs between specific existing tabs

## Proposed Approach

We will adopt a methodical, incremental approach that focuses on maintaining UI integrity while adding new functionality:

1. Create new color indicator definitions for Apollo and Metis
2. Reduce the overall height of all LEFT PANEL navigation tabs by approximately 6%
3. Add the new Apollo tab between Engram and Rhetor
4. Add the new Metis tab between Ergon and Harmonia
5. Verify proper positioning and styling of all tabs
6. Test navigation functionality with the new tabs

### Key Components Affected

- **LEFT PANEL Navigation**: Addition of two new tabs and spacing adjustments
- **CSS Styling**: Addition of new color indicators and adjustment of tab heights
- **Component Structure**: Preparation for future Apollo and Metis component implementation

### Technical Approach

- **Consistent Design**: New tabs will follow the same design pattern as existing tabs
- **Color Selection**: Use distinct color indicators that fit into the existing palette
- **Space Management**: Optimize vertical spacing to accommodate all tabs
- **Clean Implementation**: Make minimal changes to ensure stability

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Implementing the actual Apollo component functionality
- Implementing the actual Metis component functionality
- Redesigning the overall UI layout
- Changing the functionality of existing components
- Modifying backend services

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Access to the Clean Slate branch (sprint/Clean_Slate_051125)
- Understanding of the UI layout and panel structure
- Knowledge of the LEFT PANEL navigation implementation

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Focus**: Detailed planning of changes and color scheme selection
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Sprint planning documentation
  - Implementation approach document
  - Color scheme selection

### Phase 2: Implementation
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Adding new tabs and adjusting UI spacing
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Updated index.html with new navigation tabs
  - CSS adjustments for tab spacing
  - New color indicator definitions

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification
- **Duration**: 1 day
- **Focus**: Testing navigation functionality and UI appearance
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Verified tab functionality
  - UI validation across different browsers
  - Updated documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| UI becomes too crowded | High | Medium | Optimize spacing and consider future tab organization strategies |
| New colors clash with existing scheme | Medium | Low | Carefully select complementary colors from related palette |
| Tab order disruption | Medium | Low | Verify tab order after implementation |
| CSS modifications affect other components | Medium | Low | Use scoped CSS changes and thorough testing |
| Future components require additional tabs | High | Medium | Design with extensibility in mind |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Apollo tab is correctly positioned between Engram and Rhetor
- Metis tab is correctly positioned between Ergon and Harmonia
- All tabs fit in the LEFT PANEL without scrolling on standard displays
- New tab colors are visually distinct and aesthetically cohesive
- Navigation functionality works correctly with the new tabs
- UI maintains visual balance and usability

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Claude Code**: AI assistant for implementation
- **Future Developers**: Anyone who will implement Apollo and Metis components
