# Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint - Phase 2 Status

## Overview

This document reports on the completion of Phase 2 (Implementation) of the Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint. It provides a summary of work completed, changes made, and verification results.

## Completed Work

- ✅ Added Apollo navigation tab between Engram and Rhetor
- ✅ Added Metis navigation tab between Ergon and Harmonia
- ✅ Added color indicator definitions for both new tabs
- ✅ Implemented space optimization for all navigation items
- ✅ Created placeholder component files for Apollo and Metis
- ✅ Updated component registry in minimal-loader.js

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Tab Additions

1. **Apollo Tab**: 
   - Added between Engram and Rhetor
   - Label: "Apollo - Attention/Prediction" (with data attributes for Greek/functional name display)
   - Color: #FFD600 (Amber/Golden Yellow)

2. **Metis Tab**:
   - Added between Ergon and Harmonia
   - Label: "Metis - Workflows" (with data attributes for Greek/functional name display)
   - Color: #00BFA5 (Mint/Turquoise)

### Space Optimization

- Reduced navigation tab height by approximately 6%:
  - Modified `.nav-item` padding from 12px to 11px vertical
  - Reduced `.nav-item` height from 20px to 18px
  - Adjusted `.component-nav` padding from 10px to 8px vertical
  
- Ensured consistency between main navigation and footer navigation:
  - Applied the same height and padding adjustments to `.footer-buttons .control-button`

### Component Placeholders

Created minimalist placeholder files for both components:

1. **Apollo Component**:
   - Created `/components/apollo/apollo-component.html`
   - Implemented BEM naming convention (`.apollo__container`, etc.)
   - Added debug instrumentation
   - Added support for Greek/functional name display
   - Included placeholder content describing future functionality

2. **Metis Component**:
   - Created `/components/metis/metis-component.html`
   - Implemented BEM naming convention (`.metis__container`, etc.)
   - Added debug instrumentation
   - Added support for Greek/functional name display
   - Included placeholder content describing future functionality

### Component Registry

Updated the `minimal-loader.js` component registry to include the new components:

```javascript
this.componentPaths = {
  'test': '/components/test/test-component.html',
  'athena': '/components/athena/athena-component.html',
  'ergon': '/components/ergon/ergon-component.html',
  'rhetor': '/components/rhetor/rhetor-component.html',
  'apollo': '/components/apollo/apollo-component.html',
  'metis': '/components/metis/metis-component.html'
};
```

## Testing and Verification

The implementation was tested by loading the Tekton UI and verifying:

1. ✅ Apollo tab appears correctly between Engram and Rhetor
2. ✅ Metis tab appears correctly between Ergon and Harmonia
3. ✅ Both tabs have the correct color indicators
4. ✅ All tabs fit in the LEFT PANEL without scrolling
5. ✅ Tab text is fully visible and readable
6. ✅ Clicking tabs works correctly and loads placeholder components
7. ✅ Space optimization maintains visual harmony and usability

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Consistent Styling**: Ensured that both main navigation and footer navigation buttons maintain consistent heights by applying the same padding and height adjustments.
- **Component Integration**: Created placeholder components that follow the Clean Slate architecture principles for future implementation.
- **Greek/Functional Name Support**: Implemented the name display logic to support both Greek names and functional names based on the SHOW_GREEK_NAMES configuration.

## Next Steps

Phase 3 (Testing and Verification) will focus on:

1. Comprehensive cross-browser testing
2. Verification at different window sizes
3. Documentation updates
4. Final adjustments if needed

## Conclusion

Phase 2 of the Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint has been successfully completed. The changes have been implemented according to the plan, and initial testing confirms that all requirements have been met. The LEFT PANEL navigation now includes Apollo and Metis tabs positioned correctly, with appropriate space optimization to accommodate all tabs.
