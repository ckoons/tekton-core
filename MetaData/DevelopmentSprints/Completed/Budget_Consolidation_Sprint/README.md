# Budget Consolidation Sprint

## Overview

The Budget Consolidation Sprint focuses on unifying Tekton's disparate budget management implementations into a single, comprehensive system. Currently, budget functionality is scattered across Apollo and Rhetor components, with inconsistent approaches and duplicate code. This sprint will create a dedicated Budget component that combines the best features from both implementations while adding new capabilities for automated price monitoring.

## Goals

1. **Unified Budget Component**: Consolidate Apollo and Rhetor budget implementations
2. **Automated Price Updates**: Add capability to track LLM pricing changes from external sources
3. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Support both token allocation and cost management
4. **Component Integration**: Provide clean integration for all Tekton components

## Key Features

- **Token Budget Management**: Track and enforce token usage across different time periods
- **Cost Tracking**: Calculate and track financial costs for LLM API usage
- **Multi-Source Price Monitoring**: Automatically update pricing from multiple sources
- **Budget Enforcement Policies**: Flexible policies for warning and restricting usage
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting on token usage and costs
- **Component Integration**: Clean APIs and client libraries for other components

## Current Status

This sprint is in the planning phase. The required documents have been created:

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): Overview, goals, and approach
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and rationales
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed tasks and phasing
- [Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Guide for Claude to implement the project

## Implementation Phases

The sprint will be implemented in three phases:

1. **Phase 1: Core Budget Engine** - Basic budget engine with allocation and tracking
2. **Phase 2: Price Monitoring and Integration** - Automated price updates and component integration
3. **Phase 3: Reporting and Visualization** - Comprehensive reporting and basic dashboard

## Documents

## Timeline

This sprint is expected to take 4 weeks to complete:

- Phase 1: 2 weeks
- Phase 2: 1 week
- Phase 3: 1 week

## Key Components Affected

- **Budget**: New component to be implemented
- **Apollo**: Will delegate budget management to Budget component
- **Rhetor**: Will delegate budget management to Budget component
- **Hephaestus UI**: Will add budget visualization components

## Team

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Claude**: AI assistant implementing the sprint
- **Component Owners**: Stakeholders for affected components
