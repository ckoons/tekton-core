# Budget Consolidation Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made during the Budget Consolidation Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The architectural decisions in this document focus on consolidating the budget management functionality across components into a unified, comprehensive system with automated price tracking.

## Decision 1: Unified Budget Component Architecture

### Context

Currently, Tekton has two separate budget implementations: Apollo's token-focused approach and Rhetor's cost-focused approach. Both have valuable features, but their separation leads to duplication, inconsistency, and maintenance challenges. We need to determine how to consolidate these into a unified system that functions as a standard Tekton component.

### Decision

Create a full-fledged Tekton component with an LLM assistant, using a layered architecture that separates core budget concerns from specialized functionality:

1. **Core Layer**: Foundational budget tracking and enforcement
2. **Integration Layer**: Adapters for different components and LLM providers
3. **Service Layer**: API endpoints, CLI, MCP protocol support, and event handlers
4. **Assistant Layer**: LLM-based budget optimization and recommendations
5. **Reporting Layer**: Analytics and reporting capabilities

The Budget component will be structured as a complete Tekton component with all standard interfaces and its own LLM assistant, while following the Tekton component lifecycle requirements.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Enhanced Apollo Implementation

Expand Apollo's token budget manager to include cost tracking and price monitoring.

**Pros:**
- Builds on Apollo's sophisticated allocation system
- Maintains compatibility with existing Apollo integration
- Leverages existing code base and patterns

**Cons:**
- Apollo's implementation is tightly coupled to its specific use cases
- Would require significant restructuring for broader use
- Doesn't easily accommodate Rhetor's different approach to budgeting
- Would appear to prioritize Apollo's approach over Rhetor's

#### Alternative 2: Enhanced Rhetor Implementation

Expand Rhetor's cost-focused budget manager to include Apollo's token allocation features.

**Pros:**
- Builds on Rhetor's practical cost tracking
- Already has basic provider pricing models
- More focused on financial concerns

**Cons:**
- Less sophisticated than Apollo's allocation system
- Would require significant enhancement for allocation features
- Doesn't scale as well to complex budgeting scenarios
- Would appear to prioritize Rhetor's approach over Apollo's

#### Alternative 3: Full Tekton Component (Selected)

Build a new Budget implementation as a full Tekton component with an LLM assistant that combines features from both Apollo and Rhetor, with a clean, modular design.

**Pros:**
- Creates a clean-slate implementation without legacy constraints
- Allows for proper separation of concerns
- Can be designed as a standard Tekton component with all interfaces
- Enables LLM-assisted budget optimization
- No appearance of favoritism between components
- Enables new capabilities not present in either system
- Follows Tekton's component model for consistency

**Cons:**
- Requires more upfront development effort
- Needs migration strategy for existing components
- Risk of missing subtle requirements from existing implementations
- Requires additional interfaces beyond a simple service (CLI, MCP, etc.)

### Decision Rationale

We chose Alternative 3 (Full Tekton Component) because:

1. It provides the cleanest architecture for long-term maintenance
2. It allows us to combine the best features of both systems without compromise
3. It creates a properly scoped component with clear responsibilities and standard interfaces
4. It enables new capabilities like automated price monitoring and LLM assistance
5. It avoids the appearance of favoring one component's approach over another
6. It creates a consistent experience with other Tekton components

### Implications

- **Performance**: May introduce minor latency for cross-component communication, but can be optimized with local caching
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improves maintainability by centralizing budget logic
- **Extensibility**: Designed for extension with new providers, pricing models, and reporting capabilities
- **Security**: Centralizes access control for budget information
- **Learning curve**: Requires learning the Budget component interfaces, but they will follow Tekton standards
- **Integration**: Requires updates to Apollo and Rhetor to use the new system
- **Dependencies**: Creates dependencies on pricing data sources and LLM for assistant capabilities
- **Component Model**: Follows Tekton's component model with CLI, API, MCP, and LLM assistant
- **UI Integration**: Requires a separate UI implementation sprint to fully integrate with Hephaestus

### Implementation Guidelines

- Use a domain-driven design approach with clear boundaries
- Implement a plugin architecture for price data sources

## Decision 2: Automated Price Update Mechanism

### Context

LLM providers frequently update their pricing, and keeping this information current in the system is critical for accurate budget tracking and enforcement. Currently, price updates require manual code changes, which is error-prone and often delayed.

### Decision

Implement a multi-source, automated price update system with verification:

1. **Primary Sources**: Direct integration with APIs like LiteLLM that maintain pricing information
2. **Secondary Sources**: Scrapers for websites like llmprices.com and pretrained.ai
3. **Verification Layer**: Cross-reference multiple sources before applying updates
4. **Manual Override**: Admin interface for manual corrections and updates
5. **Update History**: Track all price changes with timestamps and sources

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Manual Updates with Admin UI
