# Budget Consolidation Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Budget Consolidation Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on consolidating the fragmented budget management implementations found across multiple components into a unified, feature-rich budget system that provides real-time cost tracking and LLM usage optimization.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Unified Budget System**: Consolidate the existing budget implementations from Apollo and Rhetor into a single, comprehensive Budget component
2. **Automated Cost Tracking**: Implement real-time LLM cost monitoring with automatic price updates from external sources
3. **Detailed Reporting**: Create a comprehensive budget reporting system for both token usage and financial costs
4. **Budget-Aware Routing**: Enhance model selection with budget constraints and cost optimization
5. **LLM-Assisted Budget Management**: Implement Budget as a fully LLM-assisted Tekton component with its own assistant capabilities
6. **Component Integration**: Create standard component interfaces including CLI and MCP protocol support

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Cost Control**: Providing transparent monitoring and enforcement of LLM API spending
- **Resource Optimization**: Intelligently allocating token budgets to maximize value from LLM interactions
- **Financial Visibility**: Enabling detailed reporting on LLM costs for financial planning and accountability
- **Usage Patterns**: Revealing insights into how LLMs are being utilized across the system to identify optimization opportunities
- **Vendor Price Monitoring**: Automatically staying current with LLM provider pricing changes

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Currently, budget functionality in Tekton exists in multiple disparate implementations:

1. **Apollo Token Budget Manager** (`/Apollo/apollo/core/token_budget.py`):
   - Sophisticated token allocation system with policy enforcement
   - Supports tiered models (lightweight, midweight, heavyweight)
   - Multiple budget periods (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Lacks financial cost tracking

2. **Rhetor Budget Manager** (`/Rhetor/rhetor/core/budget_manager.py`):
   - Focuses on financial cost tracking and budget enforcement
   - Provider-specific pricing models
   - Simpler implementation than Apollo's but with practical cost awareness
   - Lacks Apollo's sophisticated allocation system

3. **Budget Component** (`/Budget`):
   - Currently just a placeholder with a minimal README.md file
   - No actual implementation

### Pain Points

1. **Fragmentation**: Multiple budget implementations lead to inconsistent behavior and duplicated code
2. **Feature Isolation**: Apollo has sophisticated allocation but lacks cost tracking; Rhetor has cost tracking but lacks sophisticated allocation
3. **Manual Updates**: Price changes from LLM providers must be manually updated in code
4. **Limited Reporting**: No unified view of both token usage and financial costs
5. **No Cross-Component Budgeting**: Budget enforcement happens in silos rather than across the entire system

## Proposed Approach

We will create a consolidated Budget component that combines the strengths of both Apollo and Rhetor implementations, while adding new capabilities for automated price updates and enhanced reporting. Budget will be implemented as a full Tekton component with its own LLM assistant.

1. **Create Core Budget Engine**: Develop a unified budget core that combines token allocation and cost tracking
2. **Implement Price Monitoring**: Add capability to automatically update pricing information from external sources
3. **Design Comprehensive API**: Create a flexible API that all components can use for budget management
4. **Implement Budget LLM Assistant**: Create an LLM-based assistant for the Budget component that provides budget optimization suggestions and guidance
5. **Implement Standard Interfaces**: Create CLI interface and MCP protocol support for standardized component integration
6. **Build Basic Reporting Endpoints**: Develop APIs and data models for budget reporting (note: full UI implementation will be in a separate sprint)
7. **Migrate Existing Components**: Update Apollo and Rhetor to use the new unified Budget component

**Note**: The full UI implementation for Budget will be done in a separate sprint following the Clean_Slate_Sprint approach. This sprint will focus on the core Budget component, its LLM assistant, and the necessary interfaces.

### Key Components Affected

- **Budget**: Will be transformed from a placeholder to a fully-featured Tekton component with LLM assistance
- **Apollo**: Will delegate budget management to the Budget component
- **Rhetor**: Will delegate budget management to Budget component
- **Engram**: Will need integration with the new Budget component for memory operations
- **Hermes**: Will need to register Budget as a standard Tekton component
- **Hephaestus UI**: Basic component registration (full UI implementation in a separate sprint)

### Technical Approach

1. **Full Tekton Component**: Implement Budget as a standard Tekton component with an LLM assistant
2. **Standard Interfaces**: Implement CLI, API, and MCP protocol interfaces for component integration
3. **Event-Driven Design**: Use event-based communication for budget updates and alerts
4. **External Integrations**: Create adaptable connectors to pricing information sources
5. **Tiered Implementation**: Layer the implementation from core budget engine to specialized features
6. **LLM Integration**: Implement LLM-assisted budget optimization and recommendations
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure robust handling of various pricing scenarios and budget constraints

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

This instrumentation will enable efficient debugging and diagnostics without impacting performance when disabled.

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Class and method documentation with clear purpose statements
- API contracts and parameter descriptions
- Requirements for component initialization
- Error handling strategy

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Mock price update scenarios

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Integration with external billing systems
- Custom billing and invoicing features
- Multi-tenant budget management
- Budget forecasting based on usage patterns (future enhancement)
- Full UI implementation (will be done in a separate sprint following Clean_Slate approach)
- Advanced LLM optimization strategies (initial implementation will include basic LLM capabilities)

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Existing Apollo and Rhetor budget implementations for reference
- Access to LLM provider pricing information sources
- Debug instrumentation infrastructure
- Event messaging system for cross-component communication

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Core Budget Engine
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: Building the unified budget core with both token allocation and cost tracking
- **Key Deliverables**: Core Budget API, data models, storage system, CLI interface

### Phase 2: Price Monitoring and Component Integration
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Adding automated price updates and integrating with Apollo and Rhetor
- **Key Deliverables**: Price monitoring service, component integration, MCP protocol support, API clients

### Phase 3: LLM Assistant and Reporting
