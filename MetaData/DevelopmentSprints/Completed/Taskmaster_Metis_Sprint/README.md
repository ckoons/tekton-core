# Metis Task Management Integration - Development Sprint

## Overview

This Development Sprint focuses on creating a new Metis component for the Tekton ecosystem, inspired by the Claude Task Master project. Metis will serve as an intermediary layer between requirements management (Telos) and planning (Prometheus), providing structured task management, dependency tracking, and complexity analysis.

## Sprint Documents

This sprint includes the following documents:

- [Sprint Plan](./SprintPlan.md): High-level plan outlining goals, approach, and expected outcomes
- [Architectural Decisions](./ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](./ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed implementation tasks, phasing, and requirements
- [Taskmaster_Metis_Conversation.md](./Taskmaster_Metis_Conversation.md): Initial discussion that led to this sprint

## Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. Create a Python-based Metis component implementing the core functionality of Taskmaster
2. Bridge requirements (Telos) and planning (Prometheus) using Metis as an intermediary layer
3. Implement task complexity analysis to improve resource allocation
4. Integrate with Hermes for service discovery and follow Tekton's architecture patterns

## Implementation Phases

This sprint is organized into four phases:

1. **Core Implementation**: Basic task management capabilities, data models, and API layer
2. **Telos Integration**: PRD parsing and integration with requirements management
3. **Prometheus and Ergon Integration**: Planning integration and tool recommendation
4. **Complexity Analysis and Refinement**: Advanced complexity analysis and optimization

## Value Proposition

Integrating task management through Metis provides several benefits:

- Structured transition from requirements to planning
- Clear task dependency tracking and validation
- Automated task generation from PRD documents
- Task complexity analysis for better resource allocation
- Improved visibility into project status and progress

## Getting Started

To contribute to this sprint:

1. Review the Sprint Plan and Architectural Decisions
2. Understand the Implementation Plan for detailed tasks
3. Set up the development environment
4. Begin with Phase 1 tasks and progress through the phases

## Branch Management

This sprint will use a dedicated branch following Tekton's naming convention:

```
sprint/metis-task-management-MMDDYY
```

Use the `tekton-branch-verify` utility to ensure you're on the correct branch:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/metis-task-management-MMDDYY
```

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Metis component successfully registers with Hermes
- PRD documents can be parsed into structured tasks
- Tasks can be automatically generated from requirements in Telos
- Prometheus can use task information for enhanced planning
- All tests pass with adequate coverage
- Documentation is complete and accurate
