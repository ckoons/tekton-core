# Metis Task Management Integration - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for the Metis Task Management Integration. These decisions shape the design and implementation approach of the Metis component and its integration with the broader Tekton ecosystem.

## Decision 1: Native Python Implementation vs. JavaScript Wrapper

### Context
Claude Task Master (the basis for Metis) is implemented in JavaScript/Node.js, while the Tekton ecosystem is primarily Python-based. We needed to decide whether to wrap the existing JavaScript implementation or create a new Python implementation.

### Decision
**Create a native Python implementation** rather than wrap the JavaScript implementation.

### Rationale
- **Language Consistency**: A Python implementation maintains consistency with the rest of the Tekton ecosystem.
- **Integration Simplicity**: Direct method calls between Python components are simpler and more efficient than inter-process communication.
- **Development Ecosystem**: The team can use consistent tooling, testing frameworks, and development practices.
- **Architectural Alignment**: Python implementation can better follow Tekton's architectural patterns.
- **Performance**: Avoiding the overhead of inter-language communication.

### Consequences
- Development effort will be higher initially compared to wrapping the existing implementation.
- We'll need to maintain alignment with the original Task Master concepts if we want to incorporate future enhancements.
- We gain more flexibility to adapt the implementation to Tekton's specific needs.

## Decision 2: Integration Approach with Telos and Prometheus

### Context
Metis needs to serve as a bridge between Telos (requirements) and Prometheus (planning), but we needed to decide on the specific integration approach.

### Decision
**Implement bi-directional integration with both components** using event-based communication and direct API calls.

### Rationale
- **Requirements to Tasks**: Telos needs to notify Metis when requirements change, and Metis needs to generate tasks from requirements.
- **Tasks to Planning**: Prometheus needs access to Metis's task structure and dependency information for planning.
- **Feedback Loop**: Planning insights from Prometheus may influence task structure in Metis.
- **Event-Based Architecture**: Aligns with Tekton's event-driven approach for asynchronous updates.
- **API-Based Integration**: Provides synchronous access to data when needed.

### Consequences
- Will require defining clear interface boundaries and event schemas.
- May introduce complexity in maintaining state consistency across components.
- Provides a more reactive system where changes in requirements automatically propagate to tasks and plans.

## Decision 3: Single Port Architecture for Metis

### Context
Tekton components use a "Single Port Architecture" where all communication (REST API, WebSocket, events) happens on a single port with path-based routing.

### Decision
**Implement Metis following the Single Port Architecture pattern** with a port assignment of 8800.

### Rationale
- **Consistency**: Follows Tekton's established architecture pattern.
- **Deployment Simplicity**: Simplifies firewall rules and container networking.
- **Path-Based Routing**: Clear separation of concerns with standardized paths:
  - `/api/v1/...` for REST API endpoints
  - `/ws` for WebSocket connections
  - `/events` for event-based messaging

### Consequences
- Requires implementing a routing layer that can handle different types of requests.
- May require more complex request handling logic within the component.
- Simplifies overall system architecture and deployment.

## Decision 4: Task Data Model

### Context
We need a task data model that captures Taskmaster's capabilities while integrating well with Tekton's existing data models.

### Decision
**Implement a task model with explicit mapping to Telos requirements and Prometheus planning constructs.**

### Rationale
- **Requirements Traceability**: Each task should trace back to one or more requirements in Telos.
- **Planning Integration**: Tasks should map to planning constructs in Prometheus.
- **Dependency Management**: The model should capture dependencies between tasks.
- **Complexity Analysis**: The model should support complexity analysis for resource allocation.
- **Status Tracking**: Tasks need a clear lifecycle from creation to completion.

### Consequences
- More complex data model initially but better integration and traceability.
- May require adaptation layers when communicating with components.
- Provides richer metadata for analysis and visualization.

## Decision 5: PRD Parsing Implementation

### Context
One of Taskmaster's key features is parsing PRD documents to automatically generate tasks. We needed to decide on the implementation approach.

### Decision
**Implement a multi-stage parsing approach using NLP techniques and LLM assistance.**

### Rationale
- **Structured Extraction**: Identify structured sections in PRD documents (requirements, features, etc.)
- **LLM-Assisted Parsing**: Use Claude or other LLMs to extract tasks from unstructured text.
- **Template Support**: Allow for template-based parsing for common PRD formats.
- **Validation**: Include a validation step to ensure task quality and completeness.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Support iterative refinement of automatically generated tasks.

### Consequences
- More sophisticated parsing than the original Taskmaster implementation.
- Will require integration with LLM Adapter for advanced parsing capabilities.
- Better handling of complex PRD formats and nuanced requirements.

## Decision 6: Component Registration with Hermes

### Context
Tekton components register with Hermes for service discovery and health monitoring.

### Decision
**Fully implement Hermes integration with service registration and health reporting.**

### Rationale
- **Service Discovery**: Allow other components to discover Metis through Hermes.
- **Health Monitoring**: Report health status to Hermes for system monitoring.
- **Capability Announcement**: Register Metis's capabilities for discovery by other components.
- **Configuration Management**: Utilize Hermes for consistent configuration management.

### Consequences
- Requires implementing the Hermes client interface.
- Need to define and maintain capability descriptions.
- Enables dynamic discovery and usage by other components.

## Decision 7: Task Complexity Analysis Engine

### Context
Task complexity analysis is a key feature for optimal resource allocation and breaking down complex tasks.

### Decision
**Implement a multi-factor complexity analysis engine with both heuristic and LLM-assisted approaches.**

### Rationale
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Use rule-based heuristics for basic complexity estimation.
- **LLM-Assisted Analysis**: Use LLMs for nuanced complexity assessment of task descriptions.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Consider task dependencies when estimating complexity.
- **Historical Data**: Incorporate historical data when available for more accurate estimates.
- **Resource Requirements**: Map complexity to specific resource requirements.

### Consequences
- More sophisticated than the original Taskmaster implementation.
- Will require integration with LLM Adapter for advanced analysis.
- Better resource allocation and task breakdown recommendations.

## Decision 8: Event-Driven Updates for Task Status

### Context
Task status changes need to propagate throughout the system for accurate planning and visualization.

### Decision
**Implement an event-driven architecture for task status updates.**

### Rationale
- **Real-Time Updates**: Status changes immediately propagate to interested components.
- **Loose Coupling**: Components can subscribe only to events they care about.
- **Auditability**: Event history provides an audit trail of task changes.
- **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture scales better for large numbers of tasks.

### Consequences
- Requires defining a comprehensive event schema for task updates.
- Components need to implement event handling for task updates.
- Provides a more reactive system with real-time status updates.

## Conclusion

These architectural decisions form the foundation for the Metis Task Management Integration. They prioritize native Python implementation, seamless integration with existing Tekton components, adherence to Tekton's architectural patterns, and enhanced capabilities beyond the original Taskmaster implementation.
