# Metis Task Management Integration - Updated Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides an updated implementation plan for the Metis Task Management Integration, incorporating insights from the Clean Slate Sprint process and the examination of the claude-task-master codebase. The plan outlines a methodical, phased approach to creating a Python-based Metis component that serves as an intermediary layer between requirements (Telos) and planning (Prometheus).

## Implementation Strategy

## Technical Design Details

### Architecture

Metis will follow Tekton's Single Port Architecture:

- **Port 8800**: All communications (HTTP, WebSocket, Events)
- **Path-based Routing**:
  - `/api/v1/*`: RESTful API endpoints
  - `/ws`: WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
  - `/events`: Server-Sent Events for notifications

The component will consist of several key modules:

1. **Core**: Task and dependency management
2. **Parsers**: PRD and requirement parsing
3. **Complexity**: Task complexity analysis
4. **Integration**: Telos and Prometheus connectors
5. **API**: FastAPI-based API layer

### Data Models

**Task Model**:
```python

    id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    status: TaskStatus  # Enum: pending, in_progress, review, done
    priority: Priority  # Enum: high, medium, low
    dependencies: List[str]  # List of task IDs

## Implementation Details

### PRD Parsing Implementation

The PRD parsing system will use a multi-stage approach:

1. **Document Analysis**: Break down the document into sections
2. **Structured Extraction**: Identify requirements, features, and constraints
3. **Task Generation**: Convert requirements into actionable tasks
4. **Dependency Inference**: Identify relationships between tasks
5. **Complexity Estimation**: Estimate task complexity
6. **Validation**: Ensure task quality and completeness

For unstructured text, we'll use the Tekton LLM Client with carefully crafted prompts to extract meaningful tasks and relationships.

### Complexity Analysis Engine

The complexity analysis engine will consider multiple factors:

1. **Technical Complexity**: Technical difficulty and required skills
2. **Scope Complexity**: Size and scope of the task
3. **Dependency Complexity**: Number and nature of dependencies
4. **Uncertainty**: Ambiguity and risk factors
5. **Resource Requirements**: Required time, people, and tools

The engine will use a combination of heuristic rules and LLM assistance to provide accurate complexity scores and resource recommendations.

### Task Expansion System

The task expansion system will:

1. Analyze task complexity to determine if expansion is needed
2. Identify logical decomposition points based on task description
3. Generate subtasks with appropriate granularity
4. Establish dependencies between subtasks
5. Allocate resources based on subtask requirements

This will help break down complex tasks into manageable pieces while maintaining overall project structure.

```

**Note**: The UI component will be developed in a separate sprint and will follow the Clean Slate architecture pattern.

## Next Steps

1. Create a new branch for Metis development using the Tekton branch creation tool
2. Set up the initial project structure following Tekton standards
3. Begin implementing core data models and task management
4. Create integration points with Telos and Prometheus
5. Implement the API layer with Single Port Architecture
6. Register with Hermes for service discovery

## Conclusion

This updated implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating the Metis component as a robust task management layer in the Tekton ecosystem. By following the methodical approach proven successful in the Clean Slate Sprint and leveraging insights from the claude-task-master project, we can create a well-integrated, maintainable component that enhances Tekton's capabilities.

The plan balances technical implementation details with a clear phasing strategy, ensuring steady progress and well-defined checkpoints. By focusing on core functionality first and progressively enhancing features, we can deliver value incrementally while maintaining system stability.
