# MCP Unified Integration Sprint - Updated Handoff Document

## Implementation Progress

This document provides an updated summary of the progress made on the MCP Unified Integration Sprint and outlines the next steps for continuation.

### Completed Components

1. **tekton-core**: Implemented core FastMCP integration
   - Created FastMCP integration module with decorator-based approach
   - Implemented common utilities for standardized MCP implementation
   - Added JSON schema for validation

2. **Hermes**: Implemented FastMCP integration
   - Fixed MCP service initialization issues
   - Updated MCP endpoints with better error handling
   - Integrated FastMCP with adapters for existing code

3. **Apollo**: Implemented FastMCP integration
   - Added FastMCP support to ApolloManager
   - Created MCP endpoints in Apollo API
   - Integrated standard MCP capabilities and tools

4. **Athena**: Implemented FastMCP integration
   - Created MCP module with tool definitions
   - Updated API to include MCP endpoints
   - Integrated with entity_manager and query_engine

5. **Budget**: Implemented FastMCP integration
   - Created MCP module with tool definitions
   - Used direct integration approach
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing endpoints

6. **Engram**: Implemented FastMCP integration
   - Created FastMCP module with tool definitions
   - Used parallel server approach
   - Created dedicated run script for FastMCP server

### Next Component to Implement

**Ergon** is confirmed as the next component to implement:
- Ergon already has an existing MCP client and endpoints but no FastMCP implementation yet
- Should implement FastMCP following the same pattern as previous components
- Could use either direct integration (like Budget) or parallel implementation (like Engram)

### Implementation Order for Remaining Components

The following order is recommended for updating the remaining components:

1. **Ergon** (next target)
2. **Harmonia**
3. **Hephaestus** (confirm if needed, may only be UI)
4. **Metis**
5. **Prometheus**
6. **Rhetor**
7. **Sophia**
8. **Synthesis**
9. **Telos**
10. **Terma**

## Implementation Plan for Ergon

For the Ergon component, follow these steps to implement FastMCP:

1. **Add FastMCP as a dependency**
   - Update `requirements.txt` to add `tekton-core>=0.1.0`
   - Update `setup.py` to add `tekton-core>=0.1.0` to install_requires

2. **Create MCP module**
   - Create `ergon/core/mcp/` directory
   - Create `__init__.py` that exports all tools and registration functions
   - Create `tools.py` with tool definitions using FastMCP decorators

3. **Update API with FastMCP endpoints**
   - Create an MCP router using `create_mcp_router` from FastMCP utils
   - Add standard MCP endpoints using `add_standard_mcp_endpoints`
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing MCP endpoints

4. **Adapt message handlers**
   - Implement necessary handler functions for each tool
   - Use dependency injection for component-specific dependencies
   - Register tools during application startup

5. **Add tests**
   - Create test scripts to verify the FastMCP implementation
   - Test all exposed tools and capabilities
   - Document the test procedure

6. **Update documentation**
   - Create an `MCP_INTEGRATION.md` file documenting the implementation
   - Update the ProgressSummary.md with the latest progress

## Conclusion

The FastMCP unified integration is progressing well, with successful implementations in six major components. Each implementation provides insights that can be leveraged for the remaining components. The decorator-based approach significantly improves developer experience while maintaining backward compatibility with existing MCP implementations.

Continue with the Ergon implementation following the established patterns, then proceed with the remaining components in the specified order. The goal is to create a unified, consistent MCP approach across all Tekton components, simplifying cross-component communication and future development.
