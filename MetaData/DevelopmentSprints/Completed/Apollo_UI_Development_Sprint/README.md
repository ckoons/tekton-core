# Apollo UI Development Sprint

## Overview

This Development Sprint focuses on implementing the UI component for Apollo, Tekton's executive coordinator and predictive planning system. While the Apollo backend components are being implemented in the Apollo Instantiation Sprint, this sprint specifically targets the creation of a UI component that follows the Clean Slate patterns and provides visualization and control capabilities for Apollo's functionality.

## Sprint Documents

The following documents define this sprint:

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): Outlines the high-level goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Documents key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Provides detailed implementation tasks and phases
- [Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Working Claude

## Sprint Branch

This sprint uses the branch `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125`.

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Strict Component Isolation**: Components must be completely self-contained
2. **Athena as Golden Example**: Follow the Athena component pattern exactly
3. **Progressive Implementation**: Core functionality first, then advanced features
4. **Visualization Efficiency**: Lightweight, custom visualizations for performance
5. **Service-Based Integration**: Clean separation of UI and API concerns
6. **Consistent Styling**: Adherence to Tekton UI standards and BEM conventions
7. **Thorough Testing**: Regular testing with other components to ensure isolation

## Working Guidelines for Development Sessions

For Claude Code sessions and development work during this sprint, follow these guidelines:

1. **Validate Branch First**: Always verify you're working on the correct branch before making changes
   ```bash
   git branch
   # Should show you are on sprint/Clean_Slate_051125
   ```

2. **Start Simple**: Focus on basic functionality before adding complexity
   - First make sure component structure and isolation work correctly
   - Then add basic visualizations with mock data
   - Add more complex features only after basics work

3. **Commit at Stable Points**: Create commits whenever you reach a stable point
   - Commit after basic component structure
   - Commit after tab navigation implementation
   - Commit after each major visualization is implemented
   - Commit after service layer is complete

4. **Follow Established Patterns**: 
   - Use strict component isolation patterns
   - Follow BEM naming convention for CSS
   - Use component-specific prefixes for all JavaScript functions
   - Scope all DOM queries to the component container

5. **Test Before Moving On**:
   - Verify component loads in isolation
   - Test with other components to ensure no interference
   - Check that all features function correctly

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation alongside code changes
   - Document visualization interpretations
   - Create user guides for component usage
