# Apollo UI Development Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Apollo UI Development Sprint. Apollo is Tekton's executive coordinator and predictive planning system responsible for managing LLM operations, context flow, and behavioral reliability. While the backend components are being implemented in the Apollo Instantiation Sprint, this sprint focuses exclusively on creating the Apollo UI component following the established Clean Slate UI implementation patterns.

The Apollo UI component will provide a rich interface for monitoring LLM health, managing token budgets, configuring protocols, and visualizing predictions. This component will work seamlessly within the Hephaestus UI system while maintaining strict isolation and adhering to Tekton's component standards.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Create a Complete Apollo UI Component**: Develop a fully functional UI for Apollo following the Athena component as the "golden example"
2. **Implement Standard UI Elements**: Add HEADER, MENU BAR with Attention Chat and Team Chat options, and FOOTER matching Athena's implementation
3. **Implement Monitoring Visualizations**: Create intuitive visualizations for LLM health and token budgets
4. **Develop Control Interfaces**: Build interfaces for managing protocols and actions
5. **Ensure Component Isolation**: Follow the strict component boundaries established in the Clean Slate Sprint
6. **Maintain Gold Standard Compliance**: Adhere to all UI component standards and patterns

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Enabling Executive Control**: Providing operators with visibility and control over LLM operations
- **Enhancing System Reliability**: Making Apollo's predictive capabilities accessible through a visual interface
- **Improving Operational Insight**: Offering real-time monitoring of token usage and LLM health
- **Supporting Protocol Management**: Providing a user-friendly interface for managing communication protocols
- **Facilitating Preventative Measures**: Enabling users to take action before LLM issues manifest
- **Ensuring Consistent UI Experience**: Maintaining consistency with other Tekton components

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The Apollo backend components are being implemented in the Apollo Instantiation Sprint, which includes:

- Core observer-controller architecture
- Predictive rule-first approach 
- Protocol-based integration with bidirectional messaging
- Tiered model support
- CLI tools and APIs

The UI component needs to be created from scratch, following the standards established in the Clean Slate Sprint.

### Design Constraints

1. **Component Isolation**: Must follow the strict isolation patterns from the Clean Slate Sprint
2. **Athena as Reference**: Must use Athena's implementation as the "golden example"
3. **Standard UI Elements**: Must implement HEADER, MENU BAR with chat options, and FOOTER exactly matching Athena
4. **Embedded HTML/CSS/JS**: All UI code must be contained in the component HTML file or properly imported
5. **BEM Naming Convention**: Must use BEM for consistent CSS naming
6. **DOM Scoping**: All DOM queries must be scoped to the component container

## Proposed Approach

We will adopt a methodical approach that focuses on establishing a solid foundation:

1. Create the basic Apollo UI component structure based on the Athena template, including HEADER, MENU BAR with chat options, and FOOTER
2. Ensure all standard UI elements match Athena's implementation exactly in height, style, and functionality
3. Implement the basic layout with tabs for different Apollo functions
4. Add visualizations for LLM health monitoring and token budgets
5. Implement control interfaces for protocol management
6. Create predictive forecasting visualizations
7. Add action panels for executing commands and interventions
8. Test thoroughly with other components to ensure isolation and proper functioning
9. Document the implementation for future reference

### Key Features

- **Standard UI Elements**: HEADER, MENU BAR with Attention Chat and Team Chat options, and FOOTER
- **LLM Health Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of LLM status across all sessions
- **Token Budget Interface**: Tools for viewing and adjusting token allocations
- **Protocol Management**: Interface for defining and enforcing protocols
- **Predictive Forecasting**: Visualizations of predicted LLM behavior
- **Action Panel**: Interface for executing commands (reset, compress, etc.)
- **Health Monitoring Alerts**: Visual indicators of potential issues

### UI Structure

1. **HEADER**: Matches Athena's implementation in height and style
2. **MENU BAR**: Includes Attention Chat and Team Chat options, matching Athena's height and style
3. **Tab Navigation**: Tabs for different Apollo functions
4. **Content Panels**: Display areas for each tab's content
5. **FOOTER**: Matches Athena's implementation in style and functionality

### Tab Structure

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of all LLM sessions with health indicators
2. **Sessions**: Detailed view of individual LLM sessions with metrics
3. **Token Budgets**: Tools for managing token allocations
4. **Protocols**: Interface for protocol management
5. **Forecasting**: Predictive visualizations for LLM behavior
6. **Actions**: Tools for executing commands and interventions

### Technical Approach

- **Component Isolation**: Follow strict isolation patterns to avoid interference
- **Direct DOM Handlers**: Use inline `onclick` handlers with component-specific functions
- **Protected HTML Panel**: Implement HTML panel protection
- **Localized State Management**: Maintain component state independently
- **BEM CSS Naming**: Use consistent BEM naming for all styles
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement core functionality first, then add features

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation and Structure (1 day)
- Create basic Apollo UI component following the Athena template
- Implement HEADER, MENU BAR with chat options, and FOOTER matching Athena exactly
- Implement tab structure and navigation
- Set up component isolation mechanisms
- Establish Apollo-specific styling

### Phase 2: Core Visualizations (2 days)
- Implement LLM health dashboard
- Create token budget visualizations
- Build basic session monitoring interface
- Implement protocol visualization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and Integration (2 days)
- Add forecasting visualizations
- Implement action panel
- Create settings interface
- Connect to Apollo APIs (placeholder/mock implementation)

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement (1 day)
- Test component in isolation
- Test with other components to ensure compliance
- Refine styling and interactions
- Document implementation details

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

1. The Apollo UI component loads reliably in the Hephaestus UI
2. HEADER, MENU BAR, and FOOTER match Athena's implementation exactly
3. All tabs and features function properly
4. The component adheres strictly to the Clean Slate standards
5. The component works harmoniously alongside other components
6. The UI accurately represents Apollo's functionality
7. All visual elements follow the Tekton design language

## Dependencies

- Completion of the Apollo backend architecture definition
- Access to the Apollo API specifications
- Understanding of Apollo's core functionality
- Athena component as reference implementation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Component interference with other UIs | High | Medium | Strict isolation using patterns from Clean Slate Sprint |
| Complexity of visualization implementation | Medium | Medium | Start with simple visualizations and enhance incrementally |
| Inconsistency with Athena's UI elements | High | Medium | Carefully measure and match Athena's HEADER, MENU BAR, and FOOTER |
| API integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Use mock data initially, then integrate with real APIs |
| Performance issues with real-time updates | Medium | Low | Implement efficient update patterns with configurable refresh rates |
| Misalignment with backend capabilities | High | Medium | Regular synchronization with Apollo backend development team |

## Deliverables

1. Apollo UI component HTML file with HEADER, MENU BAR, and FOOTER
2. Supporting JavaScript modules
3. CSS styles following BEM conventions
4. Documentation of the implementation
5. Integration tests
