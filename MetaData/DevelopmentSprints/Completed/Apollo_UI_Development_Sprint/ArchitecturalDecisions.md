# Apollo UI Development Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made for the Apollo UI Development Sprint. It captures the rationale behind significant design choices to guide implementation and serve as a reference for future development. Apollo is Tekton's executive coordinator and predictive planning system, and this document focuses on its UI component architecture.

## Decision 1: Strict Component Isolation Pattern

### Context

The Apollo UI component must function reliably within the Hephaestus framework alongside other components. Previous UI components suffered from interference issues when multiple components were loaded simultaneously.

### Decision

Implement strict component isolation following the Clean Slate pattern established with the Athena component:

1. Use component-specific prefixes for all JavaScript functions
2. Scope all DOM queries to the component container
3. Use inline event handlers with component-specific functions
4. Protect the HTML panel from being hidden
5. Implement UI Manager protection mechanisms
6. Follow BEM naming convention for all CSS classes

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Shared Utility Approach

**Pros:**
- Reduced code duplication
- Potentially smaller overall codebase
- Centralized updates for common functionality

**Cons:**
- Higher risk of interference between components
- Complex dependency management
- Difficult to isolate issues
- Proven to be problematic in previous implementations

#### Alternative 2: Web Components with Shadow DOM

**Pros:**
- Native browser support for encapsulation
- Stronger isolation guarantees
- Standard web platform technology

**Cons:**
- Requires significant changes to Hephaestus loader
- Incompatible with existing component architecture
- Learning curve for future developers
- Inconsistent browser support for advanced features

### Decision Rationale

The strict component isolation pattern has been proven effective in the Clean Slate Sprint, particularly with the Athena component. It balances isolation requirements with compatibility with the existing Hephaestus framework. While it requires more boilerplate code, it significantly reduces the risk of component interference, which has been a major pain point in previous implementations.

### Implications

- **Maintainability**: Slightly more code to maintain per component
- **Reliability**: Significantly improved component stability
- **Consistency**: Consistent pattern across all components
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Future Flexibility**: Components can evolve independently

## Decision 2: Tab-Based Information Architecture

### Context

Apollo has multiple distinct areas of functionality including LLM health monitoring, token budgeting, protocol management, forecasting, and action execution. The UI needs to present these areas in a clear, organized manner.

### Decision

Implement a tab-based information architecture with:

1. A primary navigation bar with tabs for major functional areas
2. Content panels that display only when their tab is active
3. Consistent tab switching mechanism following the Clean Slate pattern
4. Optional secondary navigation within complex tabs
5. State preservation when switching between tabs

The proposed tab structure is:
- Dashboard (overview of all sessions)
- Sessions (detailed view of individual sessions)
- Token Budgets (budget management)
- Protocols (protocol management)
- Forecasting (predictive visualizations)
- Actions (command execution)

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Single-Page Layout

**Pros:**
- All information visible at once
- No need to switch between views
- Potentially faster access to all controls

**Cons:**
- Visual clutter and overwhelming interface
- Limited space for each functional area
- Poor scalability as features grow
- Difficult information hierarchy

#### Alternative 2: Wizard-Style Sequential Interface

**Pros:**
- Guides users through processes step by step
- Clearer focus on current task
- Simplified decision-making

**Cons:**
- Less efficient for experienced users
- Cumbersome for quick monitoring tasks
- Not well-suited for dashboard information
- Poor fit for parallel monitoring activities

### Decision Rationale

The tab-based approach provides a clear separation of concerns while maintaining a clean, uncluttered interface. It follows established patterns in the Tekton UI ecosystem, specifically in the Athena component, which has proven effective. This approach offers flexibility for future expansion while keeping the interface manageable.

### Implications

- **User Experience**: Logical grouping improves discoverability
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new tabs for future functionality
- **Focus**: Users can focus on one aspect at a time
- **Layout Efficiency**: More space for detailed information in each tab
- **Consistency**: Aligns with existing Tekton component patterns

## Decision 3: Real-Time Data Visualization Approach

### Context

Apollo needs to visualize complex data about LLM health, token usage, and predictive forecasts. These visualizations need to update in real-time to provide current information while being performant.

### Decision

Implement a layered visualization approach:

1. Use lightweight, custom-built visualizations for critical metrics
2. Adopt a polling mechanism with configurable refresh rates
3. Implement efficient DOM updates that minimize repaints
4. Use color-coded indicators for status representation
5. Provide progressive detail levels (overview â†’ detail)
6. Include interactive elements for data exploration

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Full-Featured Charting Library

**Pros:**
- Rich visualization capabilities
- Professional-looking charts and graphs
- Extensive customization options
- Built-in interactivity

**Cons:**

- Reduced client-side computation
- Potential for more complex visualizations
- Consistent rendering across browsers

**Cons:**
- Higher server load
- Less responsive to user interactions
- Increased network traffic
- Limited real-time capabilities

### Decision Rationale

Custom-built, lightweight visualizations offer the best balance between functionality, performance, and integration with the Tekton UI. This approach allows precise control over the visual language and update mechanisms while keeping the component size manageable. The layered approach ensures users get essential information at a glance but can access detailed information when needed.

### Implications

- **Performance**: Better control over rendering and update cycles
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller overall component size
- **Customization**: Full control over visual presentation
- **Consistency**: Better integration with Tekton's design language
- **Maintainability**: Requires more custom code but eliminates external dependencies

## Decision 4: Service-Based API Integration

### Context

The Apollo UI needs to communicate with the Apollo backend to retrieve data and send commands. This integration must be reliable, maintainable, and follow Tekton's architectural patterns.

### Decision

Implement a service-based API integration pattern:

1. Create an `ApolloService` class that encapsulates all API calls
2. Follow the pattern established in Athena's `AthenaClient`
3. Support both HTTP endpoints and WebSocket streaming
4. Implement graceful error handling and fallbacks
5. Use environment-aware base URL resolution
6. Encapsulate authentication and protocol details
