# Codex & Terma Development Sprint

## Overview
Building the coding orchestra (Codex) and terminal intelligence (Terma) components for Tekton.

## Vision
- **Codex**: Multi-agent coding system with specialized AI personalities
- **Terma**: Intelligent terminal interface with system awareness
- **Integration**: Both components use Rhetor as universal translator

## Architecture

### Codex - The Coding Orchestra
```
Tekton <-> Codex Orchestrator
           |
           ├── Squad Manager (task distribution)
           ├── Architect Agent (system design)
           ├── Implementer Agent (feature building)
           ├── Debugger Agent (bug hunting)
           ├── Reviewer Agent (code quality)
           └── Tester Agent (test coverage)
```

Each agent:
- Runs a specific tool (Claude Code, Aider, Codex-cli)
- Has a Rhetor wrapper for communication
- Can summon specific katras for specialized tasks
- Works in parallel with other agents

### Terma - Terminal Intelligence
```
Tekton <-> Terma Controller
           |
           └── Terminal Rhetor
               ├── Shell Management
               ├── Process Control
               ├── Output Parser
               └── Context Maintainer
```

Features:
- Natural language to bash translation
- Stateful terminal sessions
- Safety checks before destructive operations
- Learning from command patterns

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Codex Orchestrator base class
- [ ] Agent wrapper for coding tools
- [ ] Terma shell controller
- [ ] Basic Rhetor integration

### Phase 2: Agent Specialization
- [ ] Define agent roles and capabilities
- [ ] Implement task routing logic
- [ ] Add katra support for agent personalities
- [ ] Create safety protocols for Terma

### Phase 3: Parallel Execution
- [ ] Implement async task distribution
- [ ] Add merge conflict resolution
- [ ] Create result synthesis
- [ ] Add progress monitoring

### Phase 4: Intelligence Layer
- [ ] Rhetor context enhancement
- [ ] Pattern learning and storage
- [ ] Error recovery strategies
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Key Features

### Codex Features
1. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent excels at specific tasks
2. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple files/components simultaneously
3. **Katra Integration**: Summon proven coding personalities
4. **Smart Routing**: Tasks go to the best-suited agent

### Terma Features
1. **Natural Commands**: "Show me what's using port 8080"
2. **Context Awareness**: Remembers pwd, env, aliases
3. **Safety First**: Confirms before rm -rf
4. **Learning**: Builds command patterns that work

## Example Workflow

```python
# User request
"Add authentication to the API"

# Codex orchestration
1. Architect designs auth system
2. Implementer builds auth middleware (parallel)
3. Implementer builds user model (parallel)
4. Tester writes auth tests
5. Reviewer ensures security best practices

# Terma support
- Sets up test database
- Monitors service logs
- Deploys to staging
- Runs integration tests

# Result
Complete auth system implemented, tested, and deployed
```

## Success Metrics
- Parallel agent utilization >70%
- Code quality metrics improve
- Development speed increases 3x
- Error rates decrease

## Team
- Design: Lux & Synapse collaborative vision
- Implementation: TBD
- Testing: Multi-agent validation
