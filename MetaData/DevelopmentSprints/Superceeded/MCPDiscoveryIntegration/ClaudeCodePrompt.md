# MCP Server Discovery and Integration - Implementation Instructions

## Overview

You are assisting with implementing the MCP Server Discovery and Integration capability for the Tekton project. This capability will allow users to search for, install, and configure Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, with integration into Ergon's existing tool registration system.

MCP servers act as a universal wrapper for AI-enabled applications, providing standardized interfaces for LLMs to interact with various tools and services. This sprint aims to create a system to discover, install, and integrate these servers automatically.

## Current State

The Tekton project already has:

1. An Ergon component with MCP tool registration capabilities
2. A repository system for tracking components, tools, and capabilities
3. A CLI framework for implementing commands
4. An API framework for exposing RESTful endpoints

## Your Task

Implement the MCP Server Discovery and Integration capability according to the implementation plan. The work is divided into five phases:

1. Core Framework and Discovery Service
2. Installation and Configuration System
3. Ergon Integration
4. Command-Line Interface
5. API Endpoints

Each phase builds on the previous ones, so they should be implemented in order.

## Important Files and Locations

- The main Ergon repository code is in `/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Ergon/ergon/`
- Existing MCP integration code is in `/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Ergon/ergon/core/repository/mcp/`
- The CLI framework is in `/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Ergon/ergon/cli/`
- The API framework is in `/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Ergon/ergon/api/`

## Required Verification Steps

Before beginning your implementation, verify that you're on the correct branch using:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/mcp-discovery-250507
```

If the branch doesn't exist, create it using:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-create sprint/mcp-discovery-250507
```

## Tips for Implementation

1. Follow the implementation plan closely, but feel free to suggest improvements
2. Leverage existing Ergon and Tekton functionality wherever possible
3. Use the testing framework to create tests alongside your implementation
4. Update documentation as you implement each component
5. Use type hints and docstrings for all functions and classes
6. Follow the single-purpose principle from Tekton's AI-centric development paradigm

## Starting Point

Begin by implementing the core framework and discovery service as outlined in Phase 1 of the implementation plan. This involves:

1. Creating the directory structure
2. Implementing the base registry interface
3. Implementing registry sources for NPM, PyPI, and GitHub
4. Defining the metadata schema
5. Implementing the caching system
6. Creating the discovery service

Once you've completed Phase 1, move on to Phase 2, and so on.

## Testing Your Implementation

Create comprehensive tests for your implementation, including:

1. Unit tests for each class and method
2. Integration tests for the end-to-end flows
3. Security tests for the installation and execution

Use Ergon's existing testing framework and conventions.

## Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation for your implementation, including:

1. Module and function documentation (docstrings)
2. User guides for the CLI and API
3. Examples of common workflows
4. Security considerations

Follow Tekton's documentation standards and templates.

## Deliverables

1. Implementation of all phases outlined in the implementation plan
2. Comprehensive tests
3. Complete documentation
4. Status report after each phase

## Final Steps

After completing the implementation:

1. Verify that all tests pass
2. Ensure all documentation is complete and accurate
3. Create a final status report summarizing what was accomplished
4. Prepare a pull request for the branch
