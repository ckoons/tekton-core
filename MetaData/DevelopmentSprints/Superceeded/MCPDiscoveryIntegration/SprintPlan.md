# Development Sprint Plan: MCP Server Discovery and Integration

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Name:** MCPDiscoveryIntegration
**Date:** 2025-05-07
**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Branch Name:** sprint/mcp-discovery-250507

## Business Need

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers act as a universal wrapper for AI-enabled applications, providing standardized interfaces for LLMs to interact with various tools and services. However, discovering, installing, and configuring these servers is currently a manual and fragmented process. There's no central registry or discovery mechanism that allows users to find MCP servers with specific capabilities or automate their installation.

The Tekton ecosystem, particularly the Ergon component, is well-positioned to address this gap by implementing a comprehensive MCP server discovery and integration capability. This would enhance Tekton's utility as an orchestration system and make AI tooling more accessible.

## Goals

1. Create a unified system for discovering MCP servers across multiple repositories (NPM, PyPI, GitHub, etc.)
2. Develop capabilities to search for MCP servers by functionality, tags, or other metadata
3. Build automated installation and configuration utilities for found MCP servers
4. Integrate with Ergon's existing MCP and tool registration systems
5. Provide a CLI interface for users to search, install, and configure MCP servers
6. Create documentation and examples for the new capabilities

## Success Criteria

1. Users can search for MCP servers by capability and requirements
2. Users can install MCP servers with a single command
3. Installed MCP servers are automatically registered with Ergon
4. The solution supports all major MCP server types (Python, Node.js, etc.)
5. Documentation is comprehensive and includes examples
6. The implementation follows Tekton's self-discovery and registration philosophy

## Risks and Dependencies

1. **API Limitations**: External package registries may have rate limits or lack comprehensive search capabilities
2. **Security Concerns**: Installing third-party packages involves security risks
3. **Versioning Issues**: Different MCP servers may have incompatible versions or dependencies
4. **Credential Management**: Some MCP servers require API keys or other credentials

## High-Level Approach

The implementation will be structured in three main components:

1. **MCP Server Discovery**: A multi-source registry crawler and search system
2. **MCP Server Integration**: Automated installation and configuration utilities
3. **CLI and API**: User interfaces for searching and managing MCP servers

We will leverage Ergon's existing tool registration capabilities and extend them to handle external MCP servers. The implementation will follow Tekton's AI-centric development paradigm, with a focus on composable, single-purpose tools and protocol-first development.

## Deliverables

1. MCP server discovery module with multi-source search capabilities
2. MCP server installation and configuration module
3. CLI interface for searching and managing MCP servers
4. API endpoints for programmatic access to discovery and installation features
5. Integration with Ergon's tool registration system
6. Comprehensive documentation and examples
7. Unit and integration tests

## Stakeholders

- Casey Koons (Project Manager)
- Tekton development team
- Ergon component maintainers
- MCP server users and developers

## Definition of Done

1. All code is written, tested, and documented
2. All tests pass
3. Documentation is complete and accurate
4. The implementation meets all success criteria
5. The code follows Tekton's coding standards and philosophy
6. The implementation is reviewed and approved by stakeholders
7. The branch is ready to be merged into the main branch
