# Architectural Decisions: MCP Server Discovery and Integration

## Background

Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and services. The ecosystem includes a growing number of MCP servers implementing various capabilities, but there's no central registry or discovery mechanism. This development sprint aims to create a unified system for discovering, installing, and configuring MCP servers within the Tekton ecosystem, particularly integrated with Ergon.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Multi-Source Registry Design

**Decision**: Implement a federated discovery system that searches for MCP servers across multiple sources.

**Rationale**: MCP servers are distributed across different package repositories (NPM, PyPI, GitHub) and there's no single authoritative source. A federated approach allows comprehensive discovery.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create source-specific adapters for each registry (NPM, PyPI, GitHub, etc.)
- Implement a unified search interface that aggregates results
- Use caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
- Support multiple search criteria (tags, keywords, capabilities)

### 2. Component-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Structure the implementation as composable, single-purpose components.

**Rationale**: Following Tekton's AI-centric development principles, creating small, well-defined utilities that can be composed allows for flexibility and easier maintenance.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create separate modules for discovery, installation, and configuration
- Use dependency injection for registry adapters
- Implement a plugin architecture for adding new source registries

### 3. Ergon Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Extend Ergon's existing MCP tool registration system to handle external MCP servers.

**Rationale**: Ergon already has a robust system for registering and managing MCP tools. Extending this system rather than creating a parallel one ensures consistency and reuse.

**Implementation Details**:
- Add new repository type for external MCP servers
- Extend `RepositoryService` to handle MCP server registration
- Create adapters between MCP server configurations and Ergon's tool repository

### 4. Security Model

**Decision**: Implement a security model with verification, sandboxing, and permission management.

**Rationale**: Installing and running third-party code involves security risks. A comprehensive security model is essential to protect users.

**Implementation Details**:
- Implement verification of package signatures and sources
- Create a permission model for MCP server installation and execution
- Support sandboxing of MCP server execution
- Provide clear security documentation and warnings

### 5. Transport Protocol

**Decision**: Use REST for search and installation APIs, and event-based messaging for status updates.

**Rationale**: REST provides a simple, well-understood interface for search and installation operations. Event-based messaging allows for real-time status updates during long-running operations.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create RESTful endpoints for search and installation
- Implement WebSocket-based event channels for status updates
- Follow Tekton's single-port architecture

### 6. CLI Design

**Decision**: Implement a command-line interface following Git-style subcommand pattern.

**Rationale**: A CLI provides a simple, scriptable interface for users. The Git-style subcommand pattern is familiar and extensible.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a main `mcp` command with subcommands (`search`, `install`, `config`, etc.)
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Implement shell completion for improved usability
- Provide rich output formatting options (text, JSON, YAML)

### 7. Configuration Management

**Decision**: Use a declarative configuration model with inheritance and override capabilities.

**Rationale**: MCP servers often require complex configuration. A declarative model with inheritance allows for reuse and simplification of common patterns.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create a schema-based configuration system
- Support inheritance from base configurations
- Allow overrides at multiple levels (global, user, project)
- Implement validation for configurations

### 8. Metadata Schema

**Decision**: Define a comprehensive metadata schema for MCP servers.

**Rationale**: Standardized metadata is essential for discovery, installation, and configuration. A comprehensive schema ensures consistency and enables advanced search capabilities.

**Implementation Details**:
- Define schema for capabilities, requirements, and configuration options
- Support both standard and custom metadata fields
- Implement validation for metadata
- Create mappers between different metadata formats

### 9. Installation Strategy

**Decision**: Use a virtual environment-based installation approach with dependency isolation.

**Rationale**: Dependency conflicts are a common issue with package installation. Virtual environments provide isolation and prevent conflicts.

**Implementation Details**:
- Create isolated environments for each MCP server
- Use `uv` for Python packages and npm for Node.js packages
- Implement clean uninstallation capabilities
- Support version pinning and upgrades

### 10. Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Implement a multi-level caching system for search results and package metadata.

**Rationale**: External API calls can be slow and subject to rate limits. Caching improves performance and reduces dependency on external services.

**Implementation Details**:
- Implement in-memory cache for current session
- Use disk-based cache for persistence between sessions
- Implement cache invalidation based on time and events
- Provide cache management commands
