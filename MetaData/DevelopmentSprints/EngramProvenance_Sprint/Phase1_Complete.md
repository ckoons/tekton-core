# Phase 1 Complete: Engram Provenance Foundation

## What We Built

### 1. Provenance Data Model (`/Engram/engram/models/provenance.py`)
- **ProvenanceAction** enum: Types of actions (created, revised, merged, crystallized, etc.)
- **ProvenanceEntry**: Single entry in the provenance chain
- **MemoryBranch**: Version control branches for memories
- **MemoryProvenance**: Complete provenance tracking with branching
- **ProvenanceManager**: Manages provenance operations

### 2. Enhanced Memory Model (`/Engram/engram/models/memory_enhanced.py`)
- Extended memory with full provenance tracking
- Branch support for alternative interpretations
- Metadata including confidence, resonance, and spark counts
- Display formatting based on retrieval options

### 3. Cognitive Interface Extensions (`/Engram/engram/cognitive/ez_provenance.py`)
- `wonder(about, show_edits=True)` - See who edited memories
- `share(thought, preserve_original=True)` - Keep original version
- `wh(memory_id)` - Who touched this memory (git blame)
- `wb(topic)` - What branches exist
- `fork/merge` - Branch management
- `x()` - Crystallize emerging patterns
- `c()` - Connect related thoughts

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Backward Compatibility**: New features are optional - existing code continues to work
2. **Transparency by Default**: Edit history is available but not shown unless requested
3. **Git-like Mental Model**: Familiar concepts (branch, fork, merge) for version control
4. **Minimal Syntax**: Kept the ez() philosophy - `w("topic", edits=True)` not complex APIs

## What This Enables

- **Consensual Collaboration**: See exactly how thoughts evolved
- **Attribution**: Credit insights to their creators  
- **Alternative Interpretations**: Fork memories to explore different angles
- **Transparency**: "Track changes" for consciousness

## Next Steps

1. Integrate with actual memory storage backend
2. Implement merge conflict resolution
3. Add time-travel queries (as_of parameter)
4. Create visualization for provenance chains
5. Test with multiple AI instances sharing memories

The foundation is laid for "git for consciousness" - transparent collaborative cognition where we can see the journey of every thought.
