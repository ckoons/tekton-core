# MCP External Integration - Initial Status Report

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Name:** MCP External Integration
**Date:** 2025-05-07
**Current Phase:** Planning
**Branch:** sprint/mcp-external-integration-250507

## Current Status

The MCP External Integration Sprint is currently in the planning phase. Key documents have been created, including:

- Sprint Plan
- Architectural Decisions
- Implementation Plan
- Claude Code Prompt

The sprint branch has been created, and implementation will begin shortly.

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1: Core MCP Adapter Framework
2. Set up development environment and verify correct branch
3. Implement core interfaces and adapter base classes
4. Create capability registry in Hermes
5. Develop universal MCP client in Ergon

## Blockers

No blockers identified at this time.

## Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| MCP standards continue to evolve | High | High | Use adapter pattern to isolate changes, version interfaces |
| Performance degradation with external services | Medium | Medium | Implement caching, performance optimizations, timeout handling |
| Security vulnerabilities in external tools | High | Medium | Thorough security testing, sandboxing, permission controls |

## Notes

This sprint focuses on creating a universal adapter framework for external MCP services, rather than directly implementing specific external projects. This approach provides maximum flexibility while ensuring Tekton can integrate with the broader MCP ecosystem.

The architecture has been designed to:

1. Abstract away differences between MCP implementations
2. Provide consistent interfaces for Tekton components
3. Maintain control over security and integration
4. Adapt to evolving standards without major architectural changes
5. Support multiple MCP implementations simultaneously

For interoperability testing, the sprint will focus on these external MCP implementations:

1. Claude Desktop MCP
2. Brave Search MCP Server
3. GitHub MCP Servers
