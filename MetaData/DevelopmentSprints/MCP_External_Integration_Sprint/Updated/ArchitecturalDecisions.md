# Architectural Decisions - MCP External Integration

This document captures the key architectural decisions for the MCP External Integration Sprint.

## ADR-1: Universal Adapter Pattern for MCP Integration

### Context
External MCP services are evolving rapidly, with various implementations (open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy, pipedream) each having their own approach. Directly implementing these as dependencies would create tight coupling and require significant changes as standards evolve.

### Decision
We will implement a universal adapter pattern that:
1. Defines stable interfaces for Tekton components
2. Creates adapter implementations for different MCP services
3. Handles protocol differences within adapters
4. Allows simultaneous support for multiple MCP implementations

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Flexibility to adapt to evolving standards, reduced coupling, future-proofing
- **Negative**: Additional abstraction layer, slightly increased complexity
- **Risks**: Performance overhead, potential for impedance mismatches between abstractions

### Implementation Notes
- Create MCPInterface as the stable internal API in tekton-core
- Implement MCPAdapter base class for external service adapters
- Develop UniversalMCPClient in Ergon to manage adapters
- Define protocol for adapter discovery and registration

## ADR-2: Hermes as Capability Registry and Discovery Service

### Context
With multiple external MCP services, there needs to be a central registry to catalog, discover, and manage capabilities across the ecosystem. Hermes already serves as a service registry for Tekton components and provides database services.

### Decision
We will extend Hermes to serve as the capability registry and discovery service by:
1. Implementing a CapabilityRegistry to catalog MCP tools and adapters
2. Creating capability search and matching algorithms
3. Managing adapter and tool health monitoring
4. Providing capability composition functionality

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Centralized discovery, consistent management, leverage existing infrastructure
- **Negative**: Increased responsibility for Hermes, potential performance impact
- **Risks**: Single point of failure, scaling challenges with many capabilities

### Implementation Notes
- Implement CapabilityRegistry in Hermes
- Extend database schema for tool and adapter registration
- Create capability search and matching algorithms
- Implement health monitoring for external services

## ADR-3: Security Sandboxing for External Tools

### Context
External MCP tools may present security risks if not properly isolated. Tekton needs a comprehensive security model to safely integrate external capabilities.

### Decision
We will implement a security model for external tools that:
1. Provides proper sandboxing of external tool execution
2. Implements a granular permission system for tool access
3. Creates comprehensive audit logging
4. Enforces rate limiting and resource controls

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enhanced security, controlled access, detailed auditing
- **Negative**: Performance overhead, additional complexity
- **Risks**: Security gaps, overly restrictive controls limiting functionality

### Implementation Notes
- Implement sandbox environment for tool execution
- Create permission model with fine-grained controls
- Develop audit logging system
- Implement rate limiting and resource monitoring

## ADR-4: Capability Composition Engine

### Context
Individual MCP tools often provide atomic capabilities that need to be combined to create more powerful workflows. Manual composition is error-prone and limits reusability.

### Decision
We will implement a capability composition engine that:
1. Enables combining multiple atomic capabilities into higher-level functions
2. Manages data flow between composed capabilities
3. Handles error states and fallbacks
4. Creates reusable composition templates

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Enhanced functionality, reusability, abstraction of complex workflows
- **Negative**: Additional complexity, potential for unexpected behavior
- **Risks**: Performance impact, debugging challenges with composed capabilities

### Implementation Notes
- Create composition rules and patterns
- Implement data transformation between capabilities
- Develop execution flow management
- Build reusable composition templates

## ADR-5: Semantic Capability Discovery

### Context
As the number of available MCP tools grows, simple keyword or category-based discovery becomes insufficient. Users need more intuitive ways to find the right capabilities for their needs.

### Decision
We will implement semantic capability discovery that:
1. Indexes capability descriptions and functionality
2. Provides natural language search over capabilities
3. Supports intent-based matching
4. Recommends related capabilities based on usage patterns

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved discoverability, better user experience
- **Negative**: Increased implementation complexity, search accuracy challenges
- **Risks**: Performance impact for large capability sets, irrelevant recommendations

### Implementation Notes
- Implement capability indexing in Hermes
- Create semantic search algorithms
- Develop capability recommendation engine
- Build intent-based matching system

## ADR-6: Adapter Interface Versioning

### Context
MCP is a relatively new protocol still undergoing evolution. Different implementations may support different versions or extensions of the protocol.

### Decision
We will implement explicit versioning for adapter interfaces that:
1. Supports multiple protocol versions simultaneously
2. Handles graceful degradation for missing features
3. Provides compatibility layers between versions
4. Explicitly declares supported protocol versions

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Future compatibility, support for diverse implementations
- **Negative**: Increased maintenance burden, version management complexity
- **Risks**: Version proliferation, backward compatibility challenges

### Implementation Notes
- Add version information to adapter interfaces
- Implement version negotiation during adapter registration
- Create compatibility layers for different versions
- Document version support and compatibility

## ADR-7: Registry-Based Tool Discovery

### Context
External MCP tools need to be discovered, registered, and made available to Tekton components. Manual configuration is error-prone and does not scale.

### Decision
We will implement registry-based tool discovery that:
1. Automatically discovers tools from registered adapters
2. Maintains a central catalog in Hermes
3. Provides filtering and search capabilities
4. Handles tool versioning and updates

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Simplified discovery, consistent management, automatic updates
- **Negative**: Potential discovery latency, synchronization challenges
- **Risks**: Incomplete discovery, stale registry information

### Implementation Notes
- Implement automatic tool discovery during adapter registration
- Create registry update mechanisms
- Develop search and filtering algorithms
- Build versioning and update tracking

## ADR-8: Proxy-Based Execution Model

### Context
Directly connecting Tekton components to external MCP services would create tight coupling and potential security issues.

### Decision
We will implement a proxy-based execution model where:
1. Ergon acts as the proxy between Tekton components and external services
2. All requests go through the UniversalMCPClient
3. Results are normalized before being returned to components
4. Security and logging are centralized

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Consistent security, centralized monitoring, reduced coupling
- **Negative**: Additional hop in request path, potential performance impact
- **Risks**: Single point of failure, bottleneck for high-volume requests

### Implementation Notes
- Implement proxy execution in UniversalMCPClient
- Create result normalization utilities
- Develop centralized security and logging
- Implement performance optimizations

## ADR-9: Capability-Based Testing Framework

### Context
Testing integration with external MCP services is challenging due to dependencies, changing implementations, and network issues.

### Decision
We will implement a capability-based testing framework that:
1. Creates mock adapters for testing without external dependencies
2. Validates adapter implementations against contract tests
3. Provides integration tests for real external services
4. Includes performance and security testing

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Comprehensive testing, reduced external dependencies, consistent validation
- **Negative**: Additional development effort, potential test synchronization issues
- **Risks**: Mock/real divergence, incomplete test coverage

### Implementation Notes
- Create mock adapter implementations for testing
- Develop contract test suite for adapters
- Implement integration tests for real services
- Build performance and security test framework

## ADR-10: Standardized Error Handling

### Context
Different MCP implementations handle errors in various ways, making it difficult to provide consistent error handling across the system.

### Decision
We will implement standardized error handling that:
1. Normalizes errors from different MCP implementations
2. Provides detailed context for debugging
3. Enables appropriate retry and fallback mechanisms
4. Creates consistent error reporting to clients

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved reliability, better debugging, consistent client experience
- **Negative**: Additional translation layer, potential information loss
- **Risks**: Error translation inaccuracies, error handling performance
