# MCP External Integration - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the MCP External Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on integrating external MCP servers into the Tekton ecosystem, building on the foundation established by the MCP Unified Integration Sprint.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Integrate Open-MCP**: Leverage the open-mcp registry and standardization approach in Tekton
2. **Implement Pluggedin-MCP-Proxy**: Integrate the pluggedin-mcp-proxy as a tool in Ergon
3. **Create Pipedream Integration**: Enable connectivity with Pipedream's event-driven capabilities
4. **Standardize External Tool Registration**: Create consistent patterns for registering external MCP tools
5. **Enhance Security Model**: Implement proper permission model for external MCP server access

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Expanding Tool Ecosystem**: Access to vast libraries of external MCP-compatible tools
- **Simplifying Integration**: Standard patterns for connecting to external services
- **Enhancing Workflow Automation**: Pipedream integration enables complex automation workflows
- **Improving Developer Experience**: Seamless discovery and use of external tools
- **Enabling Ecosystem Growth**: Positioning Tekton as a hub for MCP-based AI orchestration

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The MCP Unified Integration Sprint established the core foundation for MCP in Tekton:

1. **Standardized MCP Implementation**: Based on FastMCP's decorator approach
2. **Component Registration**: Reliable registration protocol across components
3. **Request Routing**: MCP request routing between components via Hermes
4. **Integration Patterns**: Basic patterns for external MCP server integration
5. **Architecture Separation**: Hermes for internal communication, Ergon for external integration

### Pain Points

While the foundation is solid, several pain points remain for external integration:

1. **Limited Discovery**: No automated way to discover external MCP servers
2. **Manual Configuration**: External MCP servers require manual configuration
3. **Security Concerns**: Insufficient sandboxing and permission management
4. **Namespace Conflicts**: No standardized way to handle tool namespace conflicts
5. **Integration Complexity**: Each external server requires custom integration code

## Proposed Approach

We will implement comprehensive external MCP server integration by:

1. **Leveraging Open-MCP Registry**: Integrate with open-mcp's registry for discovery
2. **Exposing Pluggedin-MCP-Proxy**: Implement pluggedin-mcp-proxy as a tool in Ergon
3. **Creating Pipedream Connector**: Develop a dedicated connector for Pipedream
4. **Standardizing Integration Patterns**: Create reusable patterns for external servers
5. **Implementing Security Model**: Develop comprehensive security for external tools

### Key Components Affected

- **Ergon**: Primary integration point for external MCP servers
- **tekton-core**: Enhanced with external server utilities
- **UI Components**: Updated to show external tool availability
- **Documentation**: Expanded with integration guides

### Technical Approach

The technical approach will focus on standardized, secure integration:

1. **Adapter-Based Integration**: Use adapter pattern for different server types
2. **Namespace Management**: Implement prefix management to avoid conflicts
3. **Security Sandboxing**: Create proper security boundaries for external tools
4. **Configuration Utilities**: Develop utilities for automated configuration
5. **Capability Discovery**: Implement capability crawling for external servers

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- **Full UI for Tool Management**: Complete UI redesign for tool management
- **Custom Tool Development**: Creating new MCP servers from scratch
- **Non-MCP Integration**: Integration with non-MCP-compatible systems

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- **MCP Unified Integration**: Requires completed MCP Unified Integration Sprint
- **External Projects**: Requires access to open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy, and pipedream
- **Security Framework**: Requires Tekton's security framework for proper sandboxing

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Open-MCP Integration
- **Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Focus**: Integrate with open-mcp registry and standardization
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Open-MCP registry integration
  - Standardized API conversion utilities
  - Discovery capabilities for open-mcp servers
  - Documentation for open-mcp integration

### Phase 2: Pluggedin-MCP-Proxy Implementation
- **Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Focus**: Integrate pluggedin-mcp-proxy as a tool in Ergon
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Pluggedin-MCP-Proxy adapter in Ergon
  - Multi-server aggregation capabilities
  - Namespace management for tools
  - Documentation for pluggedin-mcp-proxy integration

### Phase 3: Pipedream Integration and Security
- **Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Focus**: Create Pipedream connector and enhance security
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Pipedream connector for event-driven capabilities
  - Comprehensive security model for external tools
  - Integration examples and documentation
  - End-to-end testing and performance optimization

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| API changes in external projects | High | Medium | Pin to specific versions, create abstraction layers |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Implement thorough sandboxing, conduct security review |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Medium | Benchmark and optimize critical paths |
| Namespace conflicts | Medium | High | Implement prefix management, create conflict resolution |
| Integration complexity | High | Medium | Create standardized patterns, document extensively |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Tekton can discover and integrate open-mcp servers
- Pluggedin-mcp-proxy functions as a tool within Ergon
- Pipedream events can trigger Tekton workflows
- External tools are properly sandboxed and secure
- Documentation clearly explains integration patterns
- Performance meets or exceeds requirements

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Tekton Component Owners**: Stakeholders for affected components
- **External Project Maintainers**: For coordination on integration issues
