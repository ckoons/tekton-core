# Budget Consolidation Sprint - Claude Code Session 1

## Session Overview

In this first session of the Budget Consolidation Sprint, Claude Code implemented the foundation of the Budget component. The implementation focused on building a solid core that combines token allocation capabilities from Apollo with cost tracking functionality from Rhetor.

## Completed Work

### Project Structure
- Created the Budget component directory structure
- Set up Python package configuration
- Configured debug instrumentation for logging
- Added component initialization files
- Created run script for launching the component

### Core Data Models
- Implemented comprehensive domain models for budget management
- Created a unified model that handles both token and cost tracking
- Designed flexible policy system for budget enforcement
- Added proper validation and business rules
- Implemented support for multiple budget periods and tiers

### Storage Layer
- Created SQLAlchemy ORM models for persistence
- Implemented repository pattern for data access abstraction
- Added database connection management
- Created data initialization for default values
- Implemented repository interfaces with CRUD operations

### Budget Engine Core
- Implemented budget allocation system for token management
- Created budget policy enforcement for limit management
- Developed usage tracking for detailed monitoring
- Added reporting and analysis capabilities
- Implemented model recommendation system for cost optimization

## Current Status

The core functionality of the Budget component is implemented and ready for further development. The following components are implemented:

- `/Budget/budget/data/models.py` - Core domain entities
- `/Budget/budget/core/constants.py` - Default configuration values
- `/Budget/budget/data/db_models.py` - ORM models
- `/Budget/budget/data/repository.py` - Repository interfaces
- `/Budget/budget/core/allocation.py` - Allocation management
- `/Budget/budget/core/engine.py` - Core budget functionality
- `/Budget/budget/core/policy.py` - Policy enforcement
- `/Budget/budget/core/tracking.py` - Usage tracking

## Next Steps

For the next session, we should focus on:

1. Implementing API endpoints for the Budget component
   - RESTful API for budget management
   - Endpoints for allocation, tracking, and reporting
   - FastAPI dependencies and models
   - Error handling and validation

2. Implementing the price source adapter framework
   - Framework for fetching pricing data from external sources
   - Adapters for LiteLLM, LLMPrices.com, and Pretrained.ai
   - Price verification system
   - Scheduling for automatic updates

3. Creating the CLI interface
   - Commands for budget management
   - Commands for reporting and configuration
   - Integration with existing Tekton CLI patterns

4. Implementing MCP protocol support
   - Message handlers and event publishing
   - Hermes registration
   - Standard component integration

## Design Considerations

The Budget component is designed with the following principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Clear separation of domain entities and concerns
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access for testability and flexibility
- **Layered Architecture**: Separate core functions from external interfaces
- **Debug Instrumentation**: Comprehensive logging following Tekton standards
- **Clean API**: Well-defined interfaces for component integration

## Progress Tracking

A detailed progress tracking document has been created at `/Budget/IMPLEMENTATION_PROGRESS.md`, which outlines the current status of all components and next steps for implementation.
