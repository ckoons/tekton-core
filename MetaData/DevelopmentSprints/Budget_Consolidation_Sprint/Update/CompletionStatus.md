## Next Steps

The continuation sprint plan has been created to address all missing components. The plan is structured in phases:

1. **Component Integration (3 days)**
   - Rhetor adapter implementation
   - Complete Apollo integration
   - MCP protocol support

2. **User Interface & Experience (3 days)**
   - CLI interface implementation
   - WebSocket support
   - Dashboard UI components

3. **Budget Assistant & Documentation (2 days)**
   - Budget LLM assistant
   - Complete documentation set

See the [Continuation Sprint Plan](/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Budget_Consolidation_Sprint/Update/ContinuationSprintPlan.md) for detailed implementation instructions.

## Immediate Action Items

To continue the implementation, focus on these immediate action items:

1. **Implement Rhetor Adapter**
   - Use the [Rhetor Adapter Prompt](/Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Budget_Consolidation_Sprint/Update/RhetorAdapterPrompt.md) to create the adapter
   - Follow the Apollo adapter pattern with appropriate adaptations

2. **Complete Apollo Integration**
   - Enhance the existing Apollo adapter with migration utilities
   - Add comprehensive tests for Apollo integration

3. **Implement MCP Protocol Support**
   - Create MCP endpoints following Tekton standards
   - Implement message handlers for budget operations
   - Add event publishing for budget events

## Conclusion

The Budget Consolidation Sprint has made significant progress with the core budget functionality and Hermes integration implemented. The continuation sprint will focus on completing the remaining components and documentation to deliver a fully functional Budget component that integrates seamlessly with the Tekton ecosystem.

All necessary documentation for completing the sprint has been prepared, including detailed implementation plans, API documentation, and technical reference materials.
