# YetAnotherMCP Sprint - Phase 3 Progress Report

## Overview
This report documents the progress of Phase 3 MCP migration, where we're implementing Hermes bridges for all Tekton components to ensure their FastMCP tools are discoverable and executable through the central Hermes aggregator.

## Completed Components (6/11)

### High Priority ✅
1. **Athena** - Knowledge Graph System
   - Created `/Athena/athena/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
   - 10 tools: entity management, relationship tracking, query operations
   - Successfully bridges FastMCP tools with Hermes

2. **Budget** - Cost Management System  
   - Created `/Budget/budget/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
   - 7 tools: budget allocation, usage tracking, model recommendations
   - Maintains existing FastMCP functionality

3. **Engram** - Memory System
   - Created `/Engram/engram/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
   - Memory tools: store, recall, search, structured memory operations
   - Already had Hermes registration, added tool bridge

### Medium Priority ✅
4. **Apollo** - Executive Coordinator
   - Created `/Apollo/apollo/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
   - 12 tools: action planning, context analysis, predictive operations
   - Bridges comprehensive executive coordination tools

5. **Ergon** - Agent Framework
   - Created `/Ergon/ergon/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
   - 14 tools: agent management, workflow execution, task operations
   - Uses A2A client for agent coordination

6. **Harmonia** - Workflow Orchestration
   - Created `/Harmonia/harmonia/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`
   - Workflow tools: definition, execution, template management
   - Integrates with workflow engine for orchestration

## Remaining Components (6)

### High Priority
- **Rhetor** - LLM Service (critical for AI operations)
- **Sophia** - Embeddings Service (important for semantic operations)

### Medium Priority  
- **Metis** - Task Management
- **Prometheus** - Code Analysis
- **Synthesis** - Integration Hub
- **Telos** - Goal Management

### Low Priority
- **Hephaestus** - UI System (may not need MCP)
- **Hermes** - Already is the MCP aggregator

### Skipped (as requested)
- **Codex** - Will be rewritten
- **Terma** - Will be rewritten

## Implementation Pattern

Each component follows the same hybrid approach:

1. **Create Hermes Bridge** (`component/core/mcp/hermes_bridge.py`)
   - Extends `MCPService` from shared library
   - Loads existing FastMCP tools
   - Wraps them for Hermes compatibility
   - Registers standard tools (health, info)

2. **Update Component Startup** (`component/api/app.py`)
   - Initialize bridge after FastMCP startup
   - Pass component's engine/manager
   - Store bridge in app state

3. **Add Cleanup Handler**
   - Unregister tools on shutdown
   - Proper cleanup sequence

## Key Achievements

- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with FastMCP
- ✅ Enabled centralized tool discovery through Hermes
- ✅ Consistent implementation across all components
- ✅ Proper health monitoring and component info
- ✅ Clean shutdown and unregistration

## Next Steps

Continue with high-priority components (Rhetor, Sophia) then proceed alphabetically through medium priority components. The pattern is well-established and each component takes approximately 10-15 minutes to migrate.

## Handoff Notes

When continuing this work:
1. Use the same pattern established in completed components
2. Check for existing FastMCP implementation first
3. Ensure proper dependency injection (engine, manager, client)
4. Test with the provided test script
5. Update this progress report as components are completed
