# Development Sprints Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation related to development sprints, feature branches, and ongoing development work. It serves as a record of decisions, implementation notes, and progress throughout the development of the Tekton system.

## Structure

Documentation is organized by sprint or feature branch, with each having its own directory:

```
DevelopmentSprints/
├── Sprint1_InitialArchitecture/
├── Sprint2_ComponentFramework/
├── FeatureBranch_LLMIntegration/
└── ...
```

## Contents

Each sprint or feature branch directory typically contains:

- **README.md**: Overview of the sprint/feature goals and outcomes
- **Planning.md**: Sprint planning documents, user stories, and task breakdowns
- **Implementation.md**: Implementation notes and decisions
- **Retrospective.md**: Retrospective analysis after completion
- **ArchitecturalDecisions.md**: Record of architectural decisions made
- **Diagrams/**: Diagrams created during the sprint

## Usage

When starting a new sprint or feature branch:

1. Create a new directory with an appropriate name
2. Copy templates from the Templates directory
3. Update documentation throughout the sprint
4. Conduct a retrospective at the end of the sprint
5. Ensure all documentation is complete before closing the sprint

## Sprint Documentation

| Sprint/Feature | Start Date | End Date | Status | Key Achievements |
|----------------|------------|----------|--------|------------------|
| Sprint1_InitialArchitecture | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | Completed | Core architecture established |
| Sprint2_ComponentFramework | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | Completed | Component system implemented |
| FeatureBranch_LLMIntegration | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | In Progress | LLM adapter integration |

## Integration into Main Documentation

Once a sprint is completed:

1. Relevant architectural decisions should be migrated to the Architecture documentation
2. Implementation notes should be incorporated into component documentation
3. User guides should be updated with new features
4. API documentation should be updated with any changes
