# FastMCP Integration Development Sprint

## Overview

This directory contains the documentation and resources for the FastMCP Integration Development Sprint for the Tekton project. This sprint focuses on integrating FastMCP, a modern Pythonic framework for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with Tekton to enhance its tool and agent capabilities.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Modernize MCP Implementation**: Replace Tekton's existing MCP implementation with FastMCP's more elegant, decorator-based approach
2. **Improve Claude Code Integration**: Establish a seamless workflow for using FastMCP-powered Tekton components with Claude Code
3. **Enable Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Leverage FastMCP's client-side capabilities to enhance Tekton's inter-agent communication

## Sprint Documents

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): High-level plan including goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed implementation tasks and phasing
- [Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Claude Code implementation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- Focus: Core FastMCP integration in tekton-core
- Key deliverables: Base classes, Claude Code bridge, sampling integration

### Phase 2: Component Migration
- Focus: Migrate key components to use FastMCP
- Key deliverables: Component FastMCP servers, composition layer

### Phase 3: Claude Code Integration and Examples
- Focus: Finalize Claude Code integration and create examples
- Key deliverables: End-to-end examples, advanced features, documentation
