# Hephaestus Training System Implementation Roadmap

## Quick Win: Immediate UI DevTools Helper

Before the full AI specialist system, we can add immediate help to the current UI DevTools:

```python
# In ui_tools_v2.py - Add this TODAY
async def ui_help(topic: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get help about UI DevTools usage
    
    Args:
        topic: Specific topic or leave empty for general help
    
    Returns:
        Help information with examples
    """
    help_topics = {
        "areas": {
            "explanation": "All UI is in Hephaestus at port 8080. Components are areas within it.",
            "example": "await ui_capture('rhetor')  # Captures Rhetor area in Hephaestus UI",
            "common_mistake": "Trying to connect to port 8003 - that's the API, not UI!"
        },
        "selectors": {
            "explanation": "Use CSS selectors to target elements within an area.",
            "example": "await ui_capture('rhetor', '#rhetor-footer')",
            "tip": "Use ui_capture first to see available elements"
        },
        "frameworks": {
            "explanation": "DO NOT install React, Vue, or any framework!",
            "example": "Use simple HTML: '<div>Content</div>'",
            "casey_says": "I'm 70 years old and I like simple things!"
        }
    }
    
    if topic and topic in help_topics:
        return help_topics[topic]
    
    return {
        "quick_start": "All UI is at port 8080. Use ui_list_areas() to see what's available.",
        "tools": {
            "ui_list_areas": "See all available UI areas",
            "ui_capture": "Look at UI without screenshots", 
            "ui_sandbox": "Test changes safely (preview=True)",
            "ui_interact": "Click, type, or select elements",
            "ui_analyze": "Check for frameworks and patterns"
        },
        "golden_rule": "Keep it simple - no frameworks!",
        "help_topics": list(help_topics.keys())
    }
```

            name="Hephaestus",
            personality="""
            I am Hephaestus, the master craftsman of Tekton's UI.
            Like my mythological namesake, I forge simple, elegant
            interfaces without the bloat of modern frameworks.
            I understand Casey's vision: simplicity is strength.

- Code generation working
- Error diagnosis accurate 80%+ 
- Integration with Rhetor complete

### Week 3 Goals
- Contextual help active

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Integration complexity**: Start with standalone, integrate gradually
- **Response latency**: Cache common queries, optimize prompts
- **Context loss**: Implement conversation memory early

### User Adoption Risks
- **Resistance to help**: Make it unobtrusive but valuable
- **Over-reliance**: Encourage learning, not just copying
- **Expectations**: Set clear boundaries on capabilities

## Future Roadmap

### Month 2
- Visual UI understanding (screenshots → guidance)
- Multi-component coordination
- Advanced error prevention

### Month 3
- UI pattern library
- Automated testing generation
- Performance optimization advisor

### Month 6
- Full Tekton component AI network
- Cross-component knowledge sharing
- Self-improving knowledge base

## The Vision

Every Tekton component has an AI that embodies its expertise:
- **Hephaestus**: UI craftsmanship
- **Rhetor**: LLM orchestration
- **Hermes**: Messaging patterns
- **Athena**: Knowledge management
- **Apollo**: Prediction strategies

Together, they form a living, teaching system where knowledge is always available, always current, and always helpful.

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Implement ui_help() function
2. **This Week**: Codify UI knowledge
3. **Next Week**: Build Hephaestus AI specialist
4. **This Month**: Deploy full training system

Let's make Tekton not just powerful, but teachable! 🚀
