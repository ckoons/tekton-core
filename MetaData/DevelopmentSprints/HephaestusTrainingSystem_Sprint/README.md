# Hephaestus Training System Sprint

## Overview
The Hephaestus Training System introduces an AI specialist that embodies deep knowledge about the Hephaestus UI and its DevTools. This AI serves as an interactive guide for both human users and other AI agents learning to use Tekton's UI capabilities.

## Vision
Every Tekton component should have an AI that "is the component" - an expert that understands not just the technical details but the philosophy, best practices, and common pitfalls. For Hephaestus, this means an AI that can:
- Guide users through UI manipulation tasks
- Diagnose problems with UI DevTools usage
- Teach the fundamental architecture (Hephaestus UI at port 8080 contains all component areas)
- Prevent common mistakes (like trying to install React)
- Provide task-specific recipes and examples

## Sprint Goals
1. Create the Hephaestus AI Specialist that deeply understands:
   - Hephaestus UI architecture and layout
   - UI DevTools MCP capabilities and correct usage
   - Common UI manipulation patterns in Tekton
   - Best practices for simple, maintainable UI changes

2. Integrate with existing Rhetor AI Specialist infrastructure

3. Provide multiple interaction methods:
   - Direct chat interface through Hermes
   - MCP endpoint for programmatic consultation
   - Integration with UI DevTools for contextual help

4. Build a knowledge base of:
   - Common tasks and solutions
   - Error diagnosis and fixes
   - Architecture explanations
   - Migration guides (v1 to v2 thinking)

## Success Criteria
- New Claude instances can learn UI DevTools usage by chatting with Hephaestus AI
- Reduced errors from incorrect component/port assumptions
- Clear guidance on finding and manipulating UI areas
- Proactive prevention of framework installations
- Seamless integration with existing AI specialist infrastructure

## Technical Approach

### Core Architecture
- Leverage Rhetor's AI Specialist Manager
- Use specialized prompts and knowledge base
- Implement both synchronous and streaming responses
- Provide code examples and interactive guidance
- Include diagnostic capabilities for troubleshooting

### Knowledge Base Implementation
- **Local Vector Database** (ChromaDB/Qdrant) for efficient retrieval
- **Document Ingestion Pipeline**:
  - All UI DevTools documentation
  - Historical error patterns and resolutions
  - Successful implementation examples
  - Casey's guidance and warnings
- **Intelligent Caching**:
  - Hot cache for frequent questions (ports, basic usage)
  - Pattern recognition for common mistakes
  - Cross-session learning from all Claude interactions
- **Metadata-Rich Storage**:
  - Tag documents by type, severity, success/failure
  - Track which guidance prevents --nuclear-destruction events
  - Build understanding of confusion patterns

### Learning Capabilities
- **Historical Context**: Remember why v1 failed, why v2 succeeded
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify when Claude is about to repeat past mistakes
- **Proactive Intervention**: Warn before bad patterns are implemented
- **Evolution**: Knowledge base grows with each interaction

## Benefits
- **For Human Users**: Interactive, patient teacher for UI tasks
- **For AI Agents**: Consistent, accurate guidance on Tekton UI patterns
- **For Tekton**: Reduced support burden, better adoption, consistent practices
- **For Casey**: Less frustration from AIs trying to install React!

## Connection to Broader Vision
This sprint exemplifies Tekton's philosophy: AI agents that embody deep component knowledge, creating a self-documenting, self-teaching system. As we build more component AIs, they form a distributed knowledge network where each AI is the authoritative expert on its domain.
