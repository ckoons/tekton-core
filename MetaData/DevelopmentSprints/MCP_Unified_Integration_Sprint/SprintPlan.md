# MCP Unified Integration - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the MCP Unified Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint consolidates the previously planned FastMCP_Sprint and MCP_Integration_Sprint into a cohesive, streamlined approach for implementing a robust MCP foundation across the Tekton ecosystem.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Implement Core MCP Foundation**: Establish a unified, modern MCP implementation based on FastMCP's decorator approach
2. **Standardize Component Registration**: Create a consistent registration protocol across all Tekton components
3. **Enable Request Routing**: Implement MCP request routing between components via Hermes
4. **Create Integration Points**: Establish standardized integration patterns for external MCP servers
5. **Provide Claude Code Compatibility**: Ensure seamless use of Tekton components with Claude Code

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Reducing Development Overhead**: FastMCP's declarative approach reduces boilerplate code needed for tool definition by 60-80%
- **Enhancing System Reliability**: Standardized registration and initialization prevents component communication failures 
- **Enabling Ecosystem Integration**: Clear integration points allow incorporation of external MCP tools like open-mcp and pluggedin-mcp-proxy
- **Improving Developer Experience**: Consistent patterns across components reduce learning curve and accelerate development
- **Future-Proofing Architecture**: Modern MCP implementation provides foundation for future enhancements

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Tekton currently has a fragmented MCP implementation with several issues:

1. **Inconsistent MCP Implementation**: Different components implement MCP in incompatible ways
2. **Registration Problems**: Components face validation errors (422) during registration with Hermes
3. **Initialization Issues**: MCP services fail to initialize properly ("MCP service not initialized" errors)
4. **Routing Limitations**: No standardized mechanism for routing MCP requests between components
5. **Verbose Tool Registration**: Current tool registration requires excessive boilerplate code

### Pain Points

1. **Component Communication Failures**: Components cannot reliably communicate due to registration and initialization issues
2. **Limited Tool Discovery**: No standardized way to discover and integrate external MCP tools
3. **Debugging Complexity**: Issues with MCP services are difficult to diagnose and fix
4. **Integration Barriers**: Integrating external MCP servers requires significant custom code
5. **Claude Code Incompatibility**: No clear path for using Tekton components directly with Claude Code

## Proposed Approach

We will implement a comprehensive, unified approach to MCP integration that addresses all current issues while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements. This approach will:

1. **Leverage FastMCP**: Use FastMCP's decorator-based approach as the standard MCP implementation
2. **Standardize Registration**: Create a unified registration protocol for all components
3. **Enable Service Discovery**: Implement robust service discovery through Hermes
4. **Establish Integration Patterns**: Define standard patterns for integrating external MCP servers
5. **Separate Internal/External MCP**: Use Hermes for internal component communication and Ergon for external tool integration

### Key Components Affected

- **tekton-core**: Implement FastMCP foundation and create standard utilities
- **Hermes**: Enhance as central MCP hub with improved registration, initialization, and routing
- **Ergon**: Update to serve as the integration point for external MCP servers
- **All components**: Migrate to standardized MCP implementation

### Technical Approach

The technical approach will focus on a clean, standardized implementation:

1. **Decorator-First Design**: Use FastMCP's intuitive decorators for tool and capability definition
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Hermes: Internal component communication and orchestration
   - Ergon: External MCP server integration and tool management
3. **Protocol-First Development**: Define clear interfaces and contracts for MCP communication
4. **Integration Patterns**: Establish patterns for integrating external MCP servers (open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy)
5. **Progressive Implementation**: Implement core functionality first, then build on that foundation

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- **MCP Server Discovery**: Full discovery capabilities will be implemented in a subsequent sprint
- **UI/UX Development**: Frontend changes to support the new capabilities
- **External Tool Integration**: Actual integration of specific external tools (will be enabled but not implemented)

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- **FastMCP Library**: Requires installation and integration of the FastMCP package
- **Claude Code**: For testing integration with Claude Code MCP capabilities 
- **Existing Tekton Components**: For testing cross-component communication

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Core MCP Implementation and Registration
- **Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Focus**: Implement FastMCP in tekton-core and establish registration protocol
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - FastMCP integration in tekton-core
  - Component registration protocol implementation
  - MCP service initialization fixes
  - Registration testing utilities

### Phase 2: Cross-Component Integration
- **Duration**: 3-4 days
- **Focus**: Implement request routing and enable cross-component communication
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - MCP request routing via Hermes
  - Cross-component request handling
  - Tool capability discovery
  - Component health monitoring

### Phase 3: External Integration Points
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Focus**: Create standardized patterns for external MCP server integration
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - External MCP server integration patterns in Ergon
  - Pluggable adapter interfaces for different MCP server types
  - Integration examples for open-mcp and pluggedin-mcp-proxy
  - Security and sandboxing for external tools

### Phase 4: Claude Code Compatibility and Testing
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Focus**: Ensure seamless integration with Claude Code and finalize testing
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Claude Code integration patterns
  - Comprehensive end-to-end testing
  - Performance optimization
  - Documentation and examples

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Incompatibilities between components | High | Medium | Define strict interfaces and validate compatibility early |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Low | Implement benchmarking and optimize critical paths |
| Registration protocol complexities | High | Medium | Create detailed validation tests and error handling |
| Security concerns with external integration | High | Medium | Implement proper sandboxing and permission controls |
| Scope creep | Medium | High | Strictly prioritize core functionality and defer enhancements |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- All components can register with Hermes without errors
- MCP services initialize properly across all components
- Cross-component MCP requests route correctly
- External MCP server integration patterns are established and documented
- Claude Code can seamlessly interact with Tekton components
- All tests pass and the implementation meets performance requirements
- Documentation clearly explains the new capabilities
