## Implementation Details

The FastMCP integration provides a decorator-based approach to MCP that simplifies tool and capability definitions. For example, instead of the verbose approach:

```python
# Before (legacy approach)
tool_spec = {
    "name": "MyTool",
    "description": "Does something",
    "schema": {
        "parameters": {
            "param1": {"type": "string", "required": True}
        }
    }
}
await register_tool(tool_spec)

# Then define and register function separately
async def my_tool(param1):
    return {"result": param1}
```

You can now use the simpler decorator approach:

```python
# After (FastMCP approach)
@mcp_tool(
    name="MyTool",
    description="Does something"
)
async def my_tool(param1: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Does something with param1.
    
    Args:
        param1: First parameter
        
    Returns:
        Result
    """
    return {"result": param1}
```

The decorators automatically extract parameter information from function signatures and docstrings, reducing boilerplate and improving developer experience.

## Budget Implementation Details

The Budget component implementation showcases the flexibility of the FastMCP approach, particularly for components with existing MCP implementations. Key aspects of the Budget implementation include:

1. **Parallel Implementation**
   - Maintained the existing MCP implementation for backward compatibility
   - Added FastMCP implementation in parallel
   - Both implementations can run side-by-side

2. **Tool Organization**
   - Organized tools into three capabilities:
     - `budget_management` - Core budget functionality
     - `model_recommendations` - Model selection and optimization
     - `budget_analytics` - Usage tracking and reporting

3. **Decorator-Based Approach**
   - Used `@mcp_capability` and `@mcp_tool` decorators for all tools
   - Leveraged type hints and docstrings for parameter documentation
   - Implemented dependency injection for core services

4. **Standardized Endpoints**
   - Used shared utilities from tekton-core to add standard endpoints
   - Added `/api/mcp/health`, `/api/mcp/capabilities`, `/api/mcp/tools`, and `/api/mcp/process`
   - Maintained the legacy `/api/mcp/message` endpoint for backward compatibility

5. **Testing**
   - Created a comprehensive test script that verifies all tools
   - Tests can be run with `./examples/run_fastmcp_test.sh`

## Engram Implementation Details

The Engram component implementation demonstrates a different approach to incorporating FastMCP into an existing MCP implementation. Key aspects of the Engram implementation include:

1. **Separate Server Implementation**
   - Created a new FastMCP server in `engram/api/fastmcp_server.py`
   - Kept the existing MCP server in `engram/api/mcp_server.py` fully functional
   - Added a dedicated `run_fastmcp.sh` script to run the FastMCP server separately

2. **Tool Organization**
   - Organized tools into three capabilities:
     - `memory_operations` - Core memory storage and retrieval
     - `structured_memory` - Structured and categorized memory operations
     - `nexus_operations` - Nexus message processing

3. **Comprehensive Tool Coverage**
   - Implemented 9 tools covering all major Engram functionalities:
     - 3 memory tools (store, query, context)
     - 5 structured memory tools (add, get, update, delete, search)
     - 1 nexus tool (process)

4. **Progressive Implementation**
   - Created a modern `FastMCPAdapter` with dependency injection
   - Registered all tools with the FastMCP registry
   - Ensured deep integration with memory management services

5. **Thorough Testing**
   - Created a comprehensive test script that verifies all tools
   - Added client-side tests for the MCP client
   - Included a run script for easy testing

## Next Steps

The following tasks are planned for the next phase:

1. **Continue with Component Updates**
   - Update remaining components in this order: Harmonia, Hephaestus, Metis, etc.
   - Implement consistent MCP approach across all components
   - Leverage shared MCP utilities for standardized implementation

   - Ensure MCP implementation is compatible with Claude Code
   - Create Claude Code MCP client

## Conclusion

The FastMCP integration in tekton-core provides a solid foundation for the MCP Unified Integration Sprint. The implementation has been successfully applied to **ALL FIFTEEN** major components (Hermes, Apollo, Athena, Budget, Engram, Ergon, Harmonia, Metis, Prometheus, Rhetor, Sophia, Synthesis, Telos, and Terma), demonstrating the effectiveness and flexibility of the approach. Hephaestus was investigated and appropriately skipped as it is a UI-only component.

The Budget and Engram implementations showcase different integration strategies. Budget integrated FastMCP directly into its existing MCP endpoints, while Engram created a separate FastMCP server that runs alongside the existing one. Telos and other components follow similar parallel implementation approaches, maintaining backward compatibility while adding comprehensive capabilities through FastMCP.

By implementing a decorator-based approach with adapters for existing code, we ensure a smooth transition while significantly improving the developer experience. The shared utilities created as part of this sprint have made the implementation process more efficient and consistent across components.

**🎉 SPRINT COMPLETE**: With 15 out of 16 components now complete (93.75%), the MCP Unified Integration Sprint has achieved its primary goal of creating a unified, consistent MCP approach across all Tekton components. This foundation enables simplified cross-component communication and streamlined future development across the entire Tekton ecosystem.
