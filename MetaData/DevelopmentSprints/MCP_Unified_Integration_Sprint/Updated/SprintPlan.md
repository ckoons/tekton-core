# MCP Unified Integration - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the MCP Unified Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint consolidates the previously planned FastMCP_Sprint and MCP_Integration_Sprint into a cohesive, streamlined approach for implementing a robust MCP foundation across the Tekton ecosystem.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Implement Core MCP Foundation**: Establish a unified, modern MCP implementation based on FastMCP's decorator approach
2. **Standardize Component Registration**: Create a consistent registration protocol that unifies component and MCP registration
3. **Enable Request Routing**: Implement MCP request routing between components via Hermes
4. **Create Integration Points**: Establish standardized integration patterns for external MCP servers
5. **Provide Claude Code Compatibility**: Ensure seamless use of Tekton components with Claude Code
6. **Implement Across All Components**: Ensure all active Tekton components use consistent MCP implementation

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Reducing Development Overhead**: FastMCP's declarative approach reduces boilerplate code needed for tool definition by 60-80%
- **Enhancing System Reliability**: Standardized registration and initialization prevents component communication failures 
- **Enabling Ecosystem Integration**: Clear integration points allow incorporation of external MCP tools like open-mcp and pluggedin-mcp-proxy
- **Improving Developer Experience**: Consistent patterns across components reduce learning curve and accelerate development
- **Future-Proofing Architecture**: Modern MCP implementation provides foundation for future enhancements
- **Ensuring System-Wide Consistency**: Unified approach across all components improves maintainability

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Tekton currently has a fragmented implementation with several issues:

1. **Inconsistent MCP Implementation**: Different components implement MCP in incompatible ways
2. **Dual Registration Systems**: Separate systems for component registration and MCP registration
3. **Registration Problems**: Components face validation errors (422) during registration with Hermes
4. **Initialization Issues**: MCP services fail to initialize properly ("MCP service not initialized" errors)
5. **Routing Limitations**: No standardized mechanism for routing MCP requests between components
6. **Verbose Tool Registration**: Current tool registration requires excessive boilerplate code
7. **Mixed Component Support**: Some components have MCP implementation, others have none

### Component Status Overview

| Component | Has MCP Implementation | Registration Method | Issues |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| tekton-core | Yes - Comprehensive | N/A (Library) | Verbose implementation |
| Hermes | Yes - Full | Custom | Initialization issues |
| Engram | Yes - Full | Component+MCP | Works but verbose |
| Ergon | Yes - Partial | Component+MCP | External integration gaps |
| Apollo | No - Empty placeholder | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Athena | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Harmonia | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Prometheus | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Rhetor | Minimal | Component only | Needs standardization |
| Sophia | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Synthesis | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Telos | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Metis | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| Budget | No | Component only | Missing implementation |
| LLMAdapter | Partial | Custom | Needs standardization |

### Pain Points

1. **Component Communication Failures**: Components cannot reliably communicate due to registration and initialization issues
2. **Limited Tool Discovery**: No standardized way to discover and integrate external MCP tools
3. **Debugging Complexity**: Issues with MCP services are difficult to diagnose and fix
4. **Integration Barriers**: Integrating external MCP servers requires significant custom code
5. **Claude Code Incompatibility**: No clear path for using Tekton components directly with Claude Code
6. **Authentication Gaps**: Inconsistent authentication across registration systems
7. **Duplication of Functionality**: Parallel registration systems with overlapping capabilities

## Proposed Approach

We will implement a comprehensive, unified approach to MCP integration that addresses all current issues while establishing a solid foundation for future enhancements. This approach will:

1. **Leverage FastMCP**: Use FastMCP's decorator-based approach as the standard MCP implementation
2. **Unify Registration**: Create a single, consistent registration protocol for both component and MCP registration
3. **Enable Service Discovery**: Implement robust service discovery through Hermes
4. **Establish Integration Patterns**: Define standard patterns for integrating external MCP servers
5. **Separate Internal/External MCP**: Use Hermes for internal component communication and Ergon for external tool integration
6. **Implement Across All Components**: Ensure all active components use the standardized approach

### Components Affected

#### Core Infrastructure Components
- **tekton-core**: Implement FastMCP foundation and create standard utilities
- **Hermes**: Enhance as central MCP hub with improved registration, initialization, and routing
- **Ergon**: Update to serve as the integration point for external MCP servers

#### Memory and Knowledge Components
- **Engram**: Update memory access tools with FastMCP decorators 
- **Athena**: Implement knowledge graph access via standardized MCP

#### Planning and Workflow Components
- **Harmonia**: Implement workflow management MCP capabilities
- **Prometheus**: Add planning tools with FastMCP decorators
- **Synthesis**: Implement tool composition capabilities

#### LLM and Specialized Components
- **Rhetor**: Update LLM tool definitions with FastMCP decorators
- **LLMAdapter**: Standardize interfaces for LLM interaction
- **Apollo**: Implement predictive engine MCP integration
- **Sophia**: Add embedding capabilities via standardized MCP
- **Telos**: Implement requirements system MCP integration 
- **Metis**: Add task management MCP capabilities
- **Budget**: Implement token/cost management MCP capabilities

### Technical Approach

The technical approach will focus on a clean, standardized implementation:

1. **Decorator-First Design**: Use FastMCP's intuitive decorators for tool and capability definition
2. **Unified Registration Protocol**: Consolidate component and MCP registration into a single process
3. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Hermes: Internal component communication and orchestration
   - Ergon: External MCP server integration and tool management
4. **Protocol-First Development**: Define clear interfaces and contracts for MCP communication
5. **Integration Patterns**: Establish patterns for integrating external MCP servers (open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy)
6. **Progressive Implementation**: Implement core functionality first, then build on that foundation

### Component Migration Prioritization

Components will be migrated to the new MCP implementation in the following priority order:

1. **Tier 1 (Critical Infrastructure)**:
   - tekton-core, Hermes, Ergon

2. **Tier 2 (High Usage Components)**:
