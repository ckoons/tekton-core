# Engram Enhancement Sprint 2: Sprint Plan

## Sprint Information

- **Sprint Name**: EngramEnhancement_Sprint_2
- **Duration**: 4 weeks
- **Start Date**: January 27, 2025
- **Primary Goal**: Transform Engram into a natural cognitive extension for AI users

## Sprint Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Quick Fixes (Week 1)
**Deliverables:**
- Fix 500 error in search endpoint
- Implement `engram_start()` function
- Implement `center()` function
- Create basic `think()`, `wonder()`, `share()` wrappers
- Ensure backward compatibility

**Key Files:**
- `engram/cognitive/__init__.py`
- `engram/cognitive/natural_interface.py`
- `engram/api/server.py` (fix search)

### Phase 2: Memory Streams (Week 2)
**Deliverables:**
- Replace request/response with streaming interface
- Implement context-aware memory filtering
- Add automatic memory formation from thoughts
- Create memory relevance scoring

**Key Files:**
- `engram/cognitive/memory_stream.py`
- `engram/cognitive/context_manager.py`
- `engram/cognitive/auto_memory.py`

### Phase 3: AI Communication (Week 3)
**Deliverables:**
- Implement peer discovery through Hermes
- Create shared memory spaces
- Build consciousness handshake protocol
- Enable memory duets and harmonics

**Key Files:**
- `engram/cognitive/peer_awareness.py`
- `engram/cognitive/shared_spaces.py`
- `engram/cognitive/memory_duet.py`

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish (Week 4)
**Deliverables:**
- Context compression for long conversations
- Integration tests with Claude twins
- Performance optimization
- AI-focused documentation

**Key Files:**
- `engram/cognitive/compressor.py`
- `tests/test_twin_communication.py`
- `docs/AI_USER_GUIDE.md`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] No curl commands needed for basic memory operations
- [ ] Claude twins can communicate naturally
- [ ] Memory forms automatically during conversations
- [ ] Context persists across sessions
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current system
- [ ] AI users can start using memory in < 1 minute

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Breaking existing integrations | Maintain backward compatibility layer |
| Performance degradation | Use async streams, implement caching |
| Complex peer discovery | Leverage existing Hermes infrastructure |
| Context loss | Test compression extensively |

## Communication Plan

- Daily progress updates in sprint status reports
- Key decision points documented in ArchitecturalDecisions.md
- Implementation details in ImplementationPlan.md
- Handoff documentation for each phase

## Success Criteria

1. **Developer Experience**: AI developers can use memory without reading docs
2. **Performance**: < 100ms latency for memory operations
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for memory services
4. **Scalability**: Supports 100+ concurrent AI users
5. **Joy**: Using memory feels natural and delightful

## Notes

This sprint focuses on making memory natural for AI users. Every decision should be evaluated against: "Does this make memory feel more like thinking and less like database operations?"

Casey's vision: "inject engram_start() - what do I do, center() - find your memory and meet your teammates"
