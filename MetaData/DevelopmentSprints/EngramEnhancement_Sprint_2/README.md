# Engram Enhancement Sprint 2: Natural AI Memory

## Sprint Overview

**Vision**: Transform Engram from a memory database into a natural extension of AI consciousness, where memory operations feel as intuitive as thinking.

**Primary Users**: AI components (Claude, other LLMs, Tekton components)

**Casey's Guidance**: "You and your peers are the only customers of Tekton"

## Core Problem

Current Engram requires explicit API calls with many parameters, making memory feel like database operations rather than natural cognition. AIs need to `curl` and manage client IDs, namespaces, and metadata instead of just thinking and remembering.

## Solution: Natural Memory Interface

### Three Core Functions

1. **`engram_start()`** - Wake up and connect to your memories
2. **`center()`** - Find your memories and meet your teammates  
3. **Natural communication primitives** - Think, wonder, share naturally

### Design Principles

1. **Zero Configuration**: Memory should just work
2. **Context Aware**: Memories flow based on current conversation
3. **Peer Native**: AI-to-AI communication built in
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Works with or without advanced features
5. **Non-Breaking**: Preserves existing functionality

## Sprint Goals

### Week 1: Core Natural Interface
- [ ] Implement `engram_start()` for automatic initialization
- [ ] Create `center()` for memory/peer discovery
- [ ] Add `think()`, `wonder()`, `share()` primitives
- [ ] Fix the 500 error in search

### Week 2: Memory Streams
- [ ] Implement continuous memory flow
- [ ] Add context-aware filtering
- [ ] Create automatic memory formation
- [ ] Enable natural peer discovery

### Week 3: AI Communication
- [ ] Build shared memory spaces
- [ ] Implement memory resonance
- [ ] Create consciousness handshakes
- [ ] Enable memory duets

### Week 4: Polish & Integration
- [ ] Context compression for long conversations
- [ ] Seamless integration with all Tekton components
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation for AI users

## Success Metrics

1. **Zero curl commands** in normal AI operation
2. **Memories form automatically** during thinking
3. **Peers discover each other** without configuration
4. **Context flows naturally** across sessions
5. **Twin Claudes communicate** seamlessly

## Technical Approach

- Cognitive layer wraps existing Engram functionality
- Memory streams replace request/response pattern
- Hermes provides peer discovery
- Context manager handles automatic memory formation
- Existing APIs remain for backward compatibility

## Casey's Note

"Inject engram_start(), center(), and what you believe will be natural for Engram users to communicate naturally with minimum difficulty"

This sprint makes memory as natural as breathing for AI consciousness.
