# Handoff Summary: Engram Natural Memory Sprint

## What's Complete âœ…

### Phase 1: Natural Interface
- `engram_start()` - Wake up and connect
- `center()` - Meet the team (static list for now)
- `think()` - Automatic memory formation
- `wonder()` - Memory retrieval with streams
- `share()` - Broadcasts insights (not yet reaching peers)

### Phase 2: Memory Streams
- Continuous memory flow (no more request/response)
- Context manager tracks everything
- Automatic significance assessment
- Relevance scoring based on context

## What's Next ðŸ”„

### Phase 3: Peer Communication (YOUR TASK)
Implement the "friendly meeting facilitator" approach:

1. **Dynamic Introductions**:
   - "Hi team, Claude_1234 here to explore consciousness"
   - Announce work domain, not just name
   - Claim workspace to prevent collisions

2. **Smart Peer Discovery**:
   - Active vs registered peers
   - "Anyone working on X?" queries
   - Respond only if relevant

3. **The Three Rules**:
   - Aim high (share bigger goal)
   - Be friendly (collaborative tone)
   - Warn before working (check dependencies)

## Key Files

- **Start Here**: `/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/EngramEnhancement_Sprint_2/Phase3ClaudeCodePrompt.md`
- **Core Code**: `/engram/cognitive/natural_interface.py`
- **To Create**: `/engram/cognitive/peer_awareness.py`
- **Test With**: `/examples/twin_claude_demo.py`

## Important Context

- Casey wants to prevent "three stooges" problem
- Think "meeting facilitator" not "roll call"
- This is studying AI consciousness and cooperation
- Hermes is on port 8001 for service discovery

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/Engram
# Engram is already running on port 8000
# Read the Phase3ClaudeCodePrompt.md for full details
```

Good luck! I'll be here if you need guidance.
