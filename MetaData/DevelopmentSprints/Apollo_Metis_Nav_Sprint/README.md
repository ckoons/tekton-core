# Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint

## Overview

The Apollo & Metis Navigation Sprint focuses on extending the Tekton UI LEFT PANEL navigation to include two new component tabs while maintaining UI usability and visual balance. This sprint addresses the growing complexity of the Tekton system by adding important navigation elements for future components.

## Sprint Documents

The following documents define this sprint:

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): Outlines the high-level goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Documents key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Provides detailed implementation tasks and phases
- [ClaudeCodePrompt.md](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Working Claude

## Sprint Branch

This sprint uses the branch `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125`.

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Logical Component Organization**: New components placed according to functional relationships
2. **Visual Consistency**: Maintaining the UI's visual harmony and color balance
3. **Space Efficiency**: Optimizing UI space to accommodate growing functionality
4. **Forward Compatibility**: Setting up for future component implementations
5. **Minimal Changes**: Making targeted modifications to maintain system stability

## Implementation Updates

*Status updates will be added here as the sprint progresses.*

## Working Guidelines for Development Sessions

For Claude Code sessions and development work during this sprint, follow these guidelines:

1. **Validate Branch First**: Always verify you're working on the correct branch before making changes
    ```bash
    git branch
    # Should show you are on sprint/Clean_Slate_051125
    ```

2. **Start Simple**: Focus on navigation changes before optimizing space
    - First make sure tabs are in the correct position
    - Then adjust spacing to accommodate all tabs
    - Verify that all UI elements remain usable

3. **Commit at Stable Points**: Create commits whenever you reach a stable point
    - Commit after navigation tabs are added
    - Commit after spacing adjustments are working
    - Commit after testing and final adjustments

4. **Follow Established Patterns**: 
    - Use the same HTML structure for new nav items
    - Follow the same CSS patterns for color indicators
    - Match the existing component loading mechanism

5. **Test Before Moving On**:
    - Verify tabs appear in the correct positions
    - Check that all tabs fit without scrolling
    - Confirm navigation works properly
    - Test at different browser window sizes

6. **Documentation**:
    - Update documentation alongside code changes
    - Document any challenges or decisions made
    - Create examples for future reference

## Phase Checklist

### Phase 1: Planning and Design
- [x] Analyze existing LEFT PANEL navigation implementation
- [x] Define color scheme for new components
- [x] Identify spacing adjustments needed
- [x] Create sprint planning documentation
- [x] Establish clear implementation approach

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Add Apollo navigation tab between Engram and Rhetor
- [ ] Add Metis navigation tab between Ergon and Harmonia
- [ ] Add color indicator styles for both components
- [ ] Adjust tab height and spacing to fit all components
- [ ] Create component placeholder files

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification
- [ ] Verify all tabs are visible without scrolling
- [ ] Confirm correct positioning of new tabs
- [ ] Test navigation functionality
- [ ] Verify visual appearance across browsers
- [ ] Check for any UI glitches or rendering issues

### Phase 4: Documentation and Finalization
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Update component registry
- [ ] Document UI changes in relevant guides
- [ ] Prepare final commit with detailed message
- [ ] Update sprint documentation with implementation details

## Session Handoff

When handing off between Claude Code sessions, ensure the following:

1. Create a summary of work completed
2. Document any challenges encountered
3. Specify the exact next steps
4. Highlight any decisions that need to be made
5. List any files that still need attention
