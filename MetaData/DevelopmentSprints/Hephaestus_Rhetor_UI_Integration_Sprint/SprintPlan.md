# Hephaestus-Rhetor UI Integration Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Hephaestus-Rhetor UI Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on enabling Rhetor AI specialists to power the right panel chat interfaces in Hephaestus and enhancing the Rhetor menu bar component to expose full API capabilities.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Enable AI-Powered Component Chats**: Connect Rhetor AI specialists to power the right panel chat interfaces for all Tekton components in Hephaestus
2. **Enhance Menu Bar Integration**: Expand the Rhetor menu bar component to expose full specialist management and orchestration capabilities
3. **Implement Persistent Chat Options**: Add configurable chat history persistence with component-level settings

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Unified AI Experience**: Every Tekton component will have its own AI assistant accessible through a consistent chat interface
- **Improved Developer Productivity**: Direct AI assistance within each component's context reduces context switching
- **Enhanced Orchestration**: Menu bar access to Rhetor capabilities enables quick AI orchestration across components
- **Flexible History Management**: Users can choose to preserve or discard chat histories based on their workflow

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The Rhetor AI Integration Sprint successfully implemented:
- 6 pre-configured AI specialists with distinct roles and personalities
- Dynamic specialist creation from 8 templates
- Real-time streaming support via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- WebSocket bidirectional communication
- MCP tools for AI orchestration
- Internal specialist-to-specialist communication

However, the integration with Hephaestus remains incomplete:
- Component chat tabs exist but aren't connected to AI specialists
- The Rhetor menu bar component has limited functionality
- No cross-component AI routing infrastructure
- Chat histories are not persisted

### Pain Points

- **Disconnected AI**: Rhetor specialists exist but can't be accessed from component UIs
- **Limited Menu Access**: Users must open full Rhetor component for most operations
- **No Context Preservation**: Chat histories are lost on page refresh
- **Manual Specialist Assignment**: No automatic mapping of specialists to components

## Proposed Approach

### Key Components Affected

- **Hephaestus UI**: Enhanced terminal chat integration, component-AI mapping, streaming support
- **Rhetor Backend**: Component specialist registry, enhanced routing, persistence layer
- **Hermes Message Bus**: Component-specific topic routing for AI messages
- **Component Registry**: AI assistant configuration per component

### Technical Approach

1. **Component-AI Mapping System**
   - Pre-configured specialists for each component (e.g., "athena-assistant", "budget-assistant")
   - Dynamic creation/recreation based on component requirements
   - Specialist registry maintained in Rhetor

2. **Enhanced Message Routing**
   - Hermes topics: `ai.chat.{component_id}` for component-specific routing
   - WebSocket message enhancement with component context
   - Response routing to correct chat panels

3. **Menu Bar API Integration**
   - Expose specialist management endpoints
   - Quick actions for common operations
   - Component-aware specialist switching

4. **Chat Persistence Layer**
   - localStorage for chat histories
   - Component-level SAVE_CHAT_HISTORY setting
   - Global default in .env.tekton

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Class and method documentation with clear purpose statements
- API contracts and parameter descriptions
- Requirements for component initialization
- Error handling strategy

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for streaming operations

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Complete rewrite of Hephaestus chat UI (keeping existing bubble design)
- Cross-component AI-to-AI communication (reserved for future A2A work)
- Advanced AI orchestration features beyond basic team chat
- Migration of existing Rhetor UI to different framework

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Rhetor AI Integration Sprint completion (DONE)
- Hermes message bus operational
- Component registry system functional
- Ollama models available locally

  - Streaming support integration

### Phase 3: Menu Bar Enhancement (Days 5-6)
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Focus**: Expand Rhetor menu bar capabilities
- **Key Deliverables**:

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebSocket connection complexity | High | Medium | Use existing Hermes infrastructure, implement reconnection logic |
| Performance with multiple AI chats | Medium | High | Implement message queuing, use streaming for better UX |
| Model availability/cost | Medium | Medium | Provide Ollama fallbacks for all specialists |
| Chat history storage limits | Low | Medium | Implement size limits and rotation policies |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- All Tekton components have functional AI chat interfaces in right panel
- Rhetor menu bar provides access to key specialist management features
- Chat histories can be optionally preserved across sessions
- Streaming responses work smoothly with typing indicators
- All code follows the Debug Instrumentation Guidelines
- Documentation is complete and accurate
- Tests pass with 80% coverage
