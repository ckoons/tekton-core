# Metis Task Management Integration - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the Metis Task Management Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on integrating the capabilities of Claude Task Master (rebranded as Metis) into the Tekton ecosystem to enhance task management, dependency tracking, and complexity analysis across the platform.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Create Metis Component**: Develop a Python-based Metis component that implements the core functionality of Taskmaster while integrating with Tekton's architecture.
2. **Bridge Requirements and Planning**: Create interfaces between Telos (requirements) and Prometheus (planning) using Metis as an intermediary layer.
3. **Enhance Task Complexity Analysis**: Implement Taskmaster's complexity analysis capabilities to improve resource allocation and planning.
4. **Hermes Integration**: Register Metis with Hermes for service discovery and ensure it follows Tekton's single-port architecture pattern.

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- Improving task breakdown and dependency management, resulting in more efficient project execution
- Creating a structured bridge between requirements management and planning, reducing manual effort
- Enhancing resource optimization through better task complexity analysis
- Providing clearer visibility into project status and dependencies

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Currently, Tekton's workflow from requirements to planning lacks a structured task management layer. The Telos component manages requirements effectively, and Prometheus handles planning, but the transition between these components could be more structured:

1. Telos captures requirements in a hierarchical structure
2. Prometheus develops execution plans based on these requirements
3. There is no formal intermediary layer for structured task representation, dependency tracking, and complexity analysis

Additionally, while Prometheus works with Ergon to identify reusable workflows and tools, this process could benefit from more structured task information.

### Pain Points

- Manual effort required to translate high-level requirements into actionable tasks
- Lack of formal dependency tracking between tasks across components
- Limited visibility into task complexity, hindering optimal resource allocation
- No structured way to analyze PRD documents and automatically generate tasks
- Limited ability to track task status throughout the execution lifecycle

## Proposed Approach

We will create a new Metis component inspired by Claude Task Master but implemented in Python to align with Tekton's architecture. Metis will serve as an intermediary layer between Telos (requirements) and Prometheus (planning), providing structured task management and dependency tracking.

### Key Components Affected

- **New Component (Metis)**: Create a new Python-based component that implements Taskmaster's core functionality
- **Telos**: Add integration points to pass requirements to Metis for task generation
- **Prometheus**: Enhance planning capabilities to utilize Metis's structured task representation
- **Ergon**: Improve tool and workflow recommendations based on Metis's task complexity analysis
- **Hermes**: Register Metis as a discoverable service with appropriate interfaces

### Technical Approach

1. **Python Implementation**: Rather than directly wrapping the Node.js implementation, we will create a clean Python implementation that follows Tekton's architectural patterns while preserving Taskmaster's core concepts.

2. **Single Port Architecture**: Follow Tekton's standardized approach with REST API, WebSocket, and events all on a single port.

3. **Data Model Alignment**: Design a task model that bridges Telos's requirements structure and Prometheus's planning needs.

4. **Service Registration**: Implement Hermes integration for service discovery and health monitoring.

5. **Complexity Analysis Engine**: Implement intelligence for breaking down complex tasks and analyzing dependencies.

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- Replicating Taskmaster's CLI interface (we'll focus on the API and integration points)
- User interface enhancements to Hephaestus (would be a separate sprint)
- Changes to the core architecture of Telos or Prometheus
- Full integration with all Tekton components (focusing on Telos, Prometheus, and Ergon)

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- Access to Claude Task Master source code for reference implementation
- Functioning Telos and Prometheus components with stable APIs
- Hermes service registry for component registration
- Ergon for tool recommendations and workflow analysis

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 4 phases:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Implementing the core Metis data model, task management, and API layer
- **Key Deliverables**: Metis component with basic task management capabilities

### Phase 2: Integration with Telos and PRD Parsing
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Implementing PRD parsing and integration with Telos
- **Key Deliverables**: Ability to generate tasks from requirements in Telos

### Phase 3: Prometheus and Ergon Integration
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Integration with Prometheus for planning and Ergon for tool recommendations
- **Key Deliverables**: End-to-end workflow from requirements to planning using Metis

### Phase 4: Complexity Analysis and Refinement
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Implementing task complexity analysis and dependency validation
- **Key Deliverables**: Enhanced complexity analysis, comprehensive tests, documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data model misalignment between Telos and Metis | High | Medium | Early prototyping of integration points, schema adaptation layer |
| Complexity analysis algorithm sophistication | Medium | Medium | Start with simpler heuristics, iteratively improve |
| Performance impacts with large task graphs | Medium | Low | Implement efficient graph algorithms, benchmark with large datasets |
| Breaking changes in Taskmaster reference implementation | Medium | Low | Document alignment points, focus on core concepts rather than exact API parity |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Metis component successfully registers with Hermes and follows Tekton's architecture patterns
- PRD documents in Telos can be automatically parsed into structured tasks in Metis
- Prometheus can utilize Metis's task structure for enhanced planning
- Task complexity analysis improves resource allocation recommendations
- All component integration tests pass, demonstrating the end-to-end workflow

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Architect Claude**: Design and architecture guidance
- **Working Claude**: Implementation of Metis component
- **Tekton Component Owners**: Owners of Telos, Prometheus, and Ergon components
