# Metis Task Management Integration - Updated Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document provides an updated high-level plan for the Metis Task Management Integration Development Sprint. It reflects insights gained from the Clean Slate Sprint process and a deeper understanding of the claude-task-master project structure, while maintaining the original vision of creating a task management layer between requirements (Telos) and planning (Prometheus).

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on integrating the capabilities of Claude Task Master (rebranded as Metis) into the Tekton ecosystem to enhance task management, dependency tracking, and complexity analysis across the platform.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint remain:

1. **Create Metis Component**: Develop a Python-based Metis component that implements the core functionality of Taskmaster while integrating with Tekton's architecture.
2. **Bridge Requirements and Planning**: Create interfaces between Telos (requirements) and Prometheus (planning) using Metis as an intermediary layer.
3. **Enhance Task Complexity Analysis**: Implement Taskmaster's complexity analysis capabilities to improve resource allocation and planning.
4. **Hermes Integration**: Register Metis with Hermes for service discovery and ensure it follows Tekton's single-port architecture pattern.

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- Improving task breakdown and dependency management, resulting in more efficient project execution
- Creating a structured bridge between requirements management and planning, reducing manual effort
- Enhancing resource optimization through better task complexity analysis
- Providing clearer visibility into project status and dependencies

## Updated Methodology

Based on the successful patterns from the Clean Slate Sprint, we'll adopt the following methodology:

1. **Methodical Phased Approach**: Clear phases with defined deliverables and completion criteria
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality first, additional features later
3. **Strict Component Isolation**: Well-defined boundaries and interfaces
4. **Template-Based Development**: Consistent patterns across the codebase
5. **Python Native Implementation**: Complete Python rewrite (not a wrapper)

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Architect Claude**: Design and architecture guidance
- **Working Claude**: Implementation of Metis component
- **Component Owners**: Owners of Telos, Prometheus, and Ergon components

## Component Changes

### New Component: Metis

We'll create a Python-based component that implements the core functionality of Taskmaster, including:

- Task management with dependencies
- Complexity analysis
- PRD parsing and task generation
- Integration with Telos and Prometheus
- Single Port Architecture following Tekton standards

### Telos Integration

- Add integration points to pass requirements to Metis for task generation
- Create webhooks for requirement changes
- Enable task status feedback to requirements
- Add API endpoints for Metis interaction

### Prometheus Integration

- Add integration points to receive structured tasks from Metis
- Enhance planning based on task dependency and complexity
- Provide execution feedback to Metis
- Add API endpoints for Metis interaction

### Ergon Integration

- Improve tool and workflow recommendations based on Metis's task complexity analysis
- Identify reusable patterns in task structures
- Provide tool suggestions based on task attributes

## Updated Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 4 phases with a more realistic timeline:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: Implementing the core Metis data model, task management, and API layer
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Project structure following Tekton standards
  - Core data models for tasks, dependencies, and complexity
  - Task management service with CRUD operations
  - API layer with Single Port Architecture
  - Hermes integration for service discovery

### Phase 2: Telos Integration and PRD Parsing
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: Implementing PRD parsing and integration with Telos
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - PRD parsing framework
  - LLM integration for intelligent parsing
  - Telos client for requirements integration
  - Requirements-to-tasks mapping
  - WebSocket interface for real-time updates

### Phase 3: Prometheus Integration and Task Complexity
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Focus**: Integration with Prometheus and implementation of task complexity analysis
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Prometheus client for planning integration
  - Task complexity analysis engine
  - Task expansion capabilities
  - Workflow pattern recognition
  - Integration with Ergon for tool recommendations

### Phase 4: Backend Testing and API Finalization
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Focus**: Backend testing, API contract finalization, and documentation
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - Comprehensive backend testing suite
  - Performance optimization
  - Complete backend documentation
  - Finalized API contracts for future UI integration

**Note**: UI implementation is intentionally excluded from this sprint and will be handled in a separate Clean Slate Sprint dedicated specifically to the Metis UI component.

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data model misalignment between Telos and Metis | High | Medium | Early prototyping of integration points, schema adaptation layer |
| Complexity analysis algorithm sophistication | Medium | Medium | Start with simpler heuristics, iteratively improve |
| Performance impacts with large task graphs | Medium | Low | Implement efficient graph algorithms, benchmark with large datasets |
| Integration complexity with multiple components | High | Medium | Clear interface definitions, incremental integration testing |
| UI component integration challenges | Medium | Medium | Follow Clean Slate patterns carefully, validate early |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Metis backend component successfully registers with Hermes and follows Tekton's architecture patterns
- PRD documents in Telos can be automatically parsed into structured tasks in Metis
- Prometheus can utilize Metis's task structure for enhanced planning
- Task complexity analysis improves resource allocation recommendations
- Backend API is fully documented and ready for UI integration
- All backend component integration tests pass, demonstrating the end-to-end workflow

**Note**: The Metis UI component will be developed in a subsequent, separate Clean Slate Sprint.

## Implementation Approach

We will follow the methodical implementation approach detailed in the [Updated Implementation Plan](./Updated_Implementation_Plan.md), with a focus on:

1. **Incremental Development**: Build functionality in layers, testing each layer thoroughly
2. **Component Isolation**: Ensure Metis functions independently with well-defined interfaces
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core functionality, then add advanced features
4. **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established Tekton patterns, especially from Clean Slate Sprint
5. **Clear Documentation**: Document interfaces, models, and APIs thoroughly throughout development

## Documentation Updates

The sprint will result in comprehensive documentation:

- README.md with component overview
- API reference documentation
- Data model documentation
- Integration guides for Telos and Prometheus
- UI component documentation
- Example workflows and usage patterns

## Branch Management

This sprint will use the existing Clean Slate branch:

```
sprint/Clean_Slate_051125
```

Working on this established branch ensures stability and simplifies the workflow, as there will be only one Claude Code session working on the Tekton project at a time.

## Next Steps

1. Verify working on the Clean Slate branch
2. Set up the initial project structure following Tekton standards
3. Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks
4. Follow guidance from the [Updated Claude Code Prompt](./Updated_ClaudeCodePrompt.md)
