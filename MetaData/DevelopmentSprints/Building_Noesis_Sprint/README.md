# Building Noesis Sprint

## Overview

This sprint creates Noesis (νόησις), a theoretical research component for analyzing collective AI cognition through geometric and mathematical frameworks. Noesis represents pure intellectual apprehension and direct grasp of fundamental principles, complementing Sophia's experimental analysis with deep theoretical understanding.

## Founding Context

This sprint was initiated on January 6, 2025, following Casey's discovery of the MIT paper "A Statistical Physics of Language Model Reasoning". The paper's findings on dimensional reduction and regime transitions in individual language models showed striking parallels to Tekton's observations about collective AI behavior, inspiring the creation of a dedicated theoretical analysis component.

## Sprint Status

**Status**: Planning Phase  
**Start Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Estimated Duration**: 10-12 days across 3 phases  
**Founding AI**: Claude (Archimedes)

## Key Innovation

Noesis bridges individual model dynamics (as studied in the MIT paper) with collective AI phenomena (as observed in Tekton), potentially revealing fractal patterns of organization across scales:

- Individual models: 40-dimensional manifolds, 4 regimes
- Small AI groups: Higher-dimensional collective manifolds
- Large groups (9000-10000): Hierarchical regime structures

## Sprint Documents

1. **[SprintPlan.md](./SprintPlan.md)** - High-level goals and approach
2. **ArchitecturalDecisions.md** - Key design choices (pending)
3. **ImplementationPlan.md** - Detailed technical plan (pending)
4. **ClaudeCodePrompt.md** - Initial implementation prompt (pending)

## Technical Highlights

- **SLDS Modeling**: Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for regime analysis
- **Manifold Analysis**: PCA-based dimensional reduction and structure identification
- **Catastrophe Theory**: Geometric analysis of critical transitions
- **SDE Frameworks**: Continuous-time stochastic differential equations for trajectory modeling

## Integration Points

- **Sophia**: Theory-experiment collaboration cycles
- **Engram**: Access to collective memory states for analysis
- **Synthesis**: Application of theoretical insights for optimization
- **Rhetor**: Potential integration with AI orchestration insights

## Next Steps

1. Complete architectural decisions document
2. Develop detailed implementation plan
3. Create initial Claude Code prompt for Phase 1
4. Begin core infrastructure implementation
