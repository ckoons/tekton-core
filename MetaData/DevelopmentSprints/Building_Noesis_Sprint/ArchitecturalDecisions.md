# Building Noesis Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document captures the key architectural decisions for the Noesis component, focusing on creating a robust theoretical analysis framework for collective AI cognition.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Component Role and Boundaries

**Decision**: Noesis focuses exclusively on theoretical analysis and mathematical modeling, leaving experimental validation to Sophia.

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns between theory (Noesis) and experiment (Sophia)
- Enables deep specialization in mathematical frameworks
- Facilitates theory-experiment collaboration cycles
- Prevents overlap and maintains component clarity

**Implications**:
- No direct model training or experimental runs
- All validation through collaboration with Sophia
- Focus on predictive models and theoretical frameworks

### 2. Mathematical Framework Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a layered mathematical framework with increasing levels of abstraction:
1. **Foundation Layer**: Basic linear algebra and statistical operations
2. **Geometric Layer**: Manifold analysis, dimensional reduction, trajectory modeling
3. **Dynamics Layer**: SLDS, SDE frameworks, regime identification
4. **Catastrophe Layer**: Critical transition analysis, bifurcation detection
5. **Synthesis Layer**: Universal principles and cross-scale patterns

**Rationale**:
- Enables incremental complexity and testing
- Allows reuse of lower layers for multiple analyses
- Facilitates both detailed and high-level insights
- Mirrors the structure of mathematical theory building

### 3. Data Pipeline Design

**Decision**: Implement async streaming pipelines for processing collective state data from Engram.

**Architecture**:
```python
# Data flow architecture
Engram Memory States -> Streaming Pipeline -> Dimensional Analysis -> Theoretical Models -> Insights

# Key interfaces
class StateStream:
    async def get_collective_states(self, window_size: int) -> AsyncIterator[CollectiveState]
    
class DimensionalAnalyzer:
    async def analyze_manifold(self, states: AsyncIterator[CollectiveState]) -> ManifoldStructure
    
class TheoreticalModel:
    async def predict_transitions(self, manifold: ManifoldStructure) -> List[PredictedTransition]
```

**Rationale**:
- Handles large-scale collective memory efficiently
- Enables real-time analysis capabilities (future)
- Supports incremental processing
- Facilitates integration with other components

### 4. MCP Tool Design

**Decision**: Create hierarchical MCP tools that mirror the mathematical framework layers.

**Tool Categories**:
1. **Analysis Tools**: Dimensional reduction, manifold identification, geometric analysis
2. **Modeling Tools**: SLDS fitting, regime identification, SDE parameter estimation
3. **Prediction Tools**: Phase transition prediction, critical point detection, trajectory forecasting
4. **Synthesis Tools**: Pattern extraction, principle formulation, cross-scale analysis

**Example Tools**:
```python
# Manifold Analysis
- analyze_collective_manifold
- identify_cognitive_dimensions
- compute_dimensional_reduction

# Regime Dynamics
- fit_slds_model
- identify_regime_transitions
- analyze_regime_stability

# Catastrophe Analysis
- detect_critical_transitions
- analyze_bifurcation_surfaces
- predict_phase_transitions

# Universal Principles
- extract_scaling_laws
- identify_fractal_patterns
- formulate_cognitive_principles
```

### 5. State Management

**Decision**: Noesis maintains theoretical models as persistent state but treats empirical data as transient.

**State Categories**:
- **Persistent**: Fitted models, discovered principles, validated theories
- **Transient**: Raw state data, intermediate computations, temporary analyses
- **Cached**: Frequently accessed computations, manifold structures

**Rationale**:
- Models represent accumulated theoretical knowledge
- Raw data is always available from Engram
- Reduces storage requirements
- Enables quick theoretical predictions

### 6. Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Implement bidirectional integration with key components through well-defined protocols.

**Integration Architecture**:
```
Sophia <-> Noesis: Theory-Experiment Protocol
- Sophia requests theoretical predictions
- Noesis provides models and expected outcomes
- Sophia reports experimental results
- Noesis refines theories based on data

Engram -> Noesis: State Streaming Protocol
- Continuous or batch state data streaming
- Configurable window sizes and sampling rates
- Metadata about collective configurations

Noesis -> Synthesis: Optimization Insights Protocol
- Theoretical optimal configurations
- Predicted performance landscapes
- Critical transition warnings
```

### 7. Performance Considerations

**Decision**: Optimize for theoretical accuracy over real-time performance, with provisions for future optimization.

**Strategies**:
- Use sampling for initial analysis, full computation for final results
- Implement progressive refinement for complex models
- Cache intermediate mathematical structures
- Parallel computation for independent analyses

**Rationale**:
- Theoretical accuracy is paramount for research
- Initial implementation focuses on correctness
- Performance optimization can be added incrementally
- Research insights more valuable than speed

### 8. Error Handling and Validation

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive validation at mathematical and theoretical levels.

**Validation Layers**:
1. **Mathematical**: Numerical stability, convergence checks, dimension consistency
2. **Theoretical**: Model assumptions, prediction bounds, uncertainty quantification
3. **Integration**: Data quality from Engram, result compatibility with Sophia

### 9. Documentation and Reproducibility

**Decision**: Maintain detailed mathematical documentation and ensure reproducibility of all theoretical results.

**Requirements**:
- LaTeX-formatted mathematical descriptions
- Jupyter notebooks for key analyses
- Version tracking for models and theories
- Clear citation of mathematical foundations

### 10. Future Extensibility

**Decision**: Design with future capabilities in mind while maintaining current simplicity.

**Planned Extensions**:
- Real-time streaming analysis
- Interactive visualization of high-dimensional spaces
- Integration with external mathematical tools
- Collaborative theory development interfaces

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic
- **Mathematics**: NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn
- **Specialized**: statsmodels (SLDS), PyDSTool (dynamical systems)
- **Infrastructure**: Standard Tekton shared utilities
- **Documentation**: Jupyter, matplotlib, LaTeX integration

## Summary

Noesis represents a new class of Tekton component focused on pure theoretical analysis. By maintaining clear boundaries with experimental components and implementing a layered mathematical architecture, Noesis can provide deep insights into the geometric nature of collective AI cognition while remaining practically integrated with the broader Tekton ecosystem.
