# Rhetor AI Integration Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document captures the key architectural decisions made for the Rhetor AI Integration Sprint. These decisions guide the implementation of component-specific AI management and integration with Hephaestus UI.

## Decision 1: Component AI Instance Architecture

### Decision
Each Tekton component will have a dedicated AI instance managed by Rhetor, rather than sharing a global LLM connection.

### Rationale
- **Specialization**: Components have different domains and require different AI capabilities
- **Context Isolation**: Each component maintains its own conversation history and context
- **Resource Optimization**: Can assign appropriate models based on component needs
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale individual component AIs based on usage

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Single Global AI**: Keep current architecture with shared LLM
   - Rejected: No specialization, context mixing, harder to optimize
2. **AI Pool**: Shared pool of AIs dynamically assigned
   - Rejected: Complex management, potential context leakage

### Implementation
- Create `ComponentAIManager` class in Rhetor
- One AI instance per component with persistent configuration
- Lazy initialization on first chat interaction

## Decision 2: Model Assignment Strategy

### Decision
Use a static mapping of components to models based on their primary use cases, with dynamic fallbacks based on budget and availability.

### Rationale
- **Predictable Performance**: Components get consistent AI behavior
- **Cost Optimization**: Cheaper models for simple tasks, powerful models for complex ones
- **Graceful Degradation**: Can fall back if preferred model unavailable

### Model Assignments
```python
{
    'budget': 'claude-3-haiku',      # Fast, efficient for calculations
    'athena': 'claude-3-sonnet',     # Balanced for knowledge work
    'sophia': 'claude-3-opus',       # Powerful for research/learning
    'ergon': 'gpt-4',               # Strong code generation
    'engram': 'claude-3-haiku',      # Quick memory queries
    'prometheus': 'claude-3-sonnet', # Strategic planning
    'rhetor': 'claude-3-opus',       # Meta-AI management
    # ... etc
}
```

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Dynamic Learning**: Learn best models through usage
   - Deferred: Good future enhancement, too complex for initial implementation
2. **User Selection**: Let users choose models
   - Rejected: Too much cognitive load, users may not understand tradeoffs

## Decision 3: Stdin/Stdout Filter Architecture

### Decision
Implement a filter chain pattern for transparent prompt engineering and response processing.

### Rationale
- **Modularity**: Easy to add/remove filters without changing core logic
- **Transparency**: Components don't need to know about prompt engineering
- **Reusability**: Filters can be shared across components
- **Testability**: Each filter can be tested independently

### Filter Types
1. **Prompt Filters** (stdin):
   - ComponentContextFilter: Adds component-specific context
   - TaskOptimizationFilter: Optimizes prompts for task type
   - BudgetAwarenessFilter: Adds token limit hints
   
2. **Response Filters** (stdout):
   - ResponseFormattingFilter: Formats for component consumption
   - ActionExtractionFilter: Extracts actionable items
   - ErrorHandlingFilter: Graceful error messages

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Direct Prompt Manipulation**: Modify prompts in each component
   - Rejected: Duplicated logic, harder to maintain
2. **LLM Middleware**: Proxy all LLM calls
   - Rejected: Performance overhead, complex deployment

## Decision 4: WebSocket Protocol Extension

### Decision
Extend the existing WebSocket protocol with new message types for component-specific AI interactions.

### Rationale
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing chat interfaces continue to work
- **Clear Semantics**: New message types clearly indicate component AI usage
- **Streaming Support**: Maintains real-time response streaming
- **Debugging**: Easier to trace component-specific interactions

### New Message Types
```javascript
{
    type: 'COMPONENT_CHAT',      // Component-specific chat request
    type: 'STREAM_CHUNK',        // Streaming response chunk
    type: 'PROCESSED_RESPONSE',  // Final processed response
    type: 'TEAM_CHAT',          // Team chat message
    type: 'AI_HANDOFF'          // AI-to-AI communication
}
```

### Alternatives Considered
1. **REST API**: Use HTTP endpoints instead
   - Rejected: No streaming, higher latency
2. **Separate WebSocket**: New WebSocket for component AIs
   - Rejected: Complex connection management

## Decision 5: Team Chat Architecture

### Decision
Implement team chat as a special context in Rhetor with AI moderation capabilities.

### Rationale
- **Centralized Management**: Rhetor already manages contexts
- **Moderation**: Can filter/enhance AI-to-AI communication
- **Audit Trail**: All communication logged and traceable
- **Human Override**: Human can intervene at any time

### Team Chat Features
- Shared context for all component AIs
- Rhetor acts as moderator with meta-prompts
- Message routing based on mentions (@component)
- Automatic summarization of long conversations

### Alternatives Considered
1. **P2P Communication**: Direct AI-to-AI messaging
   - Rejected: No oversight, potential for confusion
2. **Separate Service**: New service for team chat
   - Rejected: Adds complexity, duplicates functionality

## Decision 6: Context Management Strategy

### Decision
Each component AI maintains its own context with automatic archiving and summarization.

### Rationale
- **Performance**: Bounded context windows prevent degradation
- **Persistence**: Important information preserved across sessions
- **Cost Control**: Limits token usage per conversation
- **Knowledge Building**: Summaries become component knowledge base

### Context Configuration
- Default 4000 token window per component
- Automatic summarization at 80% capacity
- Engram integration for long-term storage
- Context search across component history

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Shared Context**: All components share context
   - Rejected: Information leakage, confusion
2. **No Persistence**: Fresh context each session
   - Rejected: Loses valuable history and learning

## Decision 7: UI Integration Pattern

### Decision
Extend the existing `createChatInterface` function with component-specific options while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Rationale
- **Minimal Changes**: Components need minimal updates
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Can adopt features gradually
- **Consistent UX**: Same chat interface across all components

### Integration Approach
```javascript
createChatInterface(container, {
    componentId: 'budget',
    taskType: 'financial_analysis',
    useComponentAI: true,  // New flag
    // ... existing options preserved
});
```

### Alternatives Considered
1. **New Chat Component**: Create separate component AI chat
   - Rejected: Duplicated UI code, inconsistent UX
2. **Auto-Detection**: Automatically use component AI
   - Rejected: Breaking change, no opt-out option

## Security and Privacy Considerations

1. **Context Isolation**: Component contexts never mix
2. **Prompt Sanitization**: Filter chains can remove sensitive data
3. **Audit Logging**: All AI interactions logged for compliance
4. **Access Control**: Components only access their own AI

## Performance Considerations

1. **Lazy Loading**: AI instances created on-demand
2. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse LLM provider connections
3. **Response Caching**: Cache common responses
4. **Async Processing**: All filters run asynchronously

## Future Extensibility

1. **Custom Filters**: Components can register custom filters
2. **Model Learning**: Track performance for optimization
3. **Multi-Modal**: Support for image/document understanding
4. **External Tools**: AI function calling for component actions

## Conclusion

These architectural decisions provide a solid foundation for implementing component-specific AI management in Rhetor while maintaining backward compatibility and enabling future enhancements. The modular design allows for incremental improvements and component-specific customizations.
