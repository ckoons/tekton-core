# Logging Clarity Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for the Logging Clarity Sprint. These decisions shape the design and implementation of the centralized logging system for the Tekton ecosystem.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-1: Centralized Logger Module

**Context:**
The Tekton ecosystem currently uses direct console calls (`console.log`, `console.error`, etc.) throughout the codebase with no standardization or control mechanism.

**Decision:**
Create a centralized `logger.js` module that provides a unified logging interface for all components.

**Rationale:**
- A centralized module enables consistent logging patterns across components
- Changes to logging behavior can be made in one place
- Configuration can be managed globally rather than per-component

**Implications:**
- Components will need to be updated to use the new logger
- Existing code will require gradual refactoring
- New component templates will incorporate the logger by default

### ADR-2: Log Level Hierarchy

**Context:**
Different scenarios require different levels of logging verbosity. Development environments typically need more detail than production.

**Decision:**
Implement a hierarchical log level system with the following levels:
1. TRACE (0) - Most verbose, for detailed tracing
2. DEBUG (1) - Development debugging information
3. INFO (2) - General information
4. WARN (3) - Warnings that don't prevent operation
5. ERROR (4) - Errors that may impact functionality
6. FATAL (5) - Severe errors that prevent operation
7. OFF (6) - No logging

**Rationale:**
- Standard log levels match industry conventions
- Numeric values enable simple comparison for filtering
- Range from very verbose to completely silent provides flexibility

**Implications:**
- All logging calls must specify a level
- Users need to understand the meaning of each level
- Default level should be chosen carefully (INFO)

### ADR-3: Component-Specific Log Levels

**Context:**
Different components may require different levels of logging verbosity in the same environment.

**Decision:**
Allow log levels to be set both globally and per-component. Component-specific settings override the global setting.

**Rationale:**
- Provides fine-grained control over logging
- Enables focused debugging of specific components
- Reduces noise from unrelated components

**Implications:**
- Requires a mechanism to store and retrieve component-specific settings
- UI needs to support component-specific configuration
- Logger needs to check both global and component-specific settings

### ADR-4: Settings Integration

**Context:**
Tekton already has a Settings component for user configuration that persists preferences.

**Decision:**
Integrate logging configuration with the existing Settings component and UI.

**Rationale:**
- Leverages existing infrastructure for user preferences
- Provides a familiar interface for users
- Ensures settings persistence between sessions

**Implications:**
- Settings schema needs to be extended
- Settings UI needs new controls
- Settings persistence mechanism needs to handle logging configuration

### ADR-5: Environment Configuration

**Context:**
Deployment environments may require different default logging configurations.

**Decision:**
Support environment variable configuration through the `ENV` object in `env.js`.

**Rationale:**
- Enables configuration without code changes
- Allows different settings for development, testing, and production
- Provides a mechanism for system administrators to control logging

**Implications:**
- Environment variables need to be documented
- Logger needs to check environment configuration during initialization
- Environment settings should override defaults but be overridable by user settings

### ADR-6: Contextual Logging

**Context:**
Log messages often lack context, making it difficult to understand their source and relevance.

**Decision:**
Include standardized context in all log messages:
- Timestamp
- Log level
- Component name
- Optional context attributes

**Rationale:**
- Improves log readability and usability
- Facilitates filtering and searching
- Provides necessary context for troubleshooting

**Implications:**
- Logger interface needs to capture component information
- Log formatting needs to include contextual data
- Log parsing may be more complex

### ADR-7: Incremental Adoption

**Context:**
A full refactoring of all existing code to use the new logger would be time-consuming and risky.

**Decision:**
Design the logging system for incremental adoption, focusing first on new components and gradually updating existing ones.

**Rationale:**
- Minimizes disruption to ongoing development
- Allows gradual migration at a sustainable pace
- Provides immediate benefits for new components

**Implications:**
- Existing code will continue to use direct console calls in the near term
- Documentation needs to clearly guide adoption
- Component templates should use the new logger by default

### ADR-8: Performance Considerations

**Context:**
Logging can impact performance, especially if logging is verbose or requires complex processing.

**Decision:**
Implement efficient log level checking and ensure minimal overhead when logs are disabled.

**Rationale:**
- Logging should not significantly impact application performance
- Disabled logs should have near-zero cost
- String interpolation and object formatting should be deferred until needed

**Implications:**
- Logger implementation needs to check levels before any processing
- String formatting should be lazy-evaluated
- Performance testing should include logging scenarios

## Implementation Priorities

Based on these architectural decisions, the implementation priorities are:

1. Create the core logger module with level hierarchy
2. Implement environment variable configuration
3. Integrate with Settings component
4. Update component templates
5. Apply to new components
6. Gradually refactor existing components

## Open Questions

1. How should log output be formatted for maximum readability and usefulness?
2. Should there be a mechanism to redirect logs to different outputs (e.g., remote logging)?
3. How should errors and exceptions be integrated with the logging system?
4. Should log messages be internationalized for non-English users?

These questions will be addressed during the detailed implementation planning.
