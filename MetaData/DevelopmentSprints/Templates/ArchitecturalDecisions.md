# [Sprint Name] - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made during the [Sprint Name] Development Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The architectural decisions in this document focus on [brief description of the focus area].

## Decision 1: [Decision Title]

### Context

[Describe the context in which this decision needed to be made. What problem are we trying to solve? What constraints exist?]

### Decision

[Clearly state the decision that was made.]

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: [Alternative Title]

[Describe the first alternative approach considered]

**Pros:**
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]
- [Pro 3]

**Cons:**
- [Con 1]
- [Con 2]
- [Con 3]

#### Alternative 2: [Alternative Title]

[Describe the second alternative approach considered]

**Pros:**
- [Pro 1]
- [Pro 2]
- [Pro 3]

**Cons:**
- [Con 1]
- [Con 2]
- [Con 3]

### Decision Rationale

[Explain why the chosen approach was selected over the alternatives. Reference the specific pros/cons that were most influential.]

### Implications

[Describe the implications of this decision, both positive and negative. Consider impacts on:
- Performance
- Maintainability
- Extensibility
- Security
- Learning curve
- Integration
- Dependencies]

### Implementation Guidelines

[Provide specific guidelines for how this decision should be implemented. Include any patterns, practices, or approaches that should be followed.]

## Decision 3: [Decision Title]

[...repeat structure for each decision...]

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Considerations

[Describe any performance implications of the architectural decisions made. Include any benchmarks, expectations, or requirements.]

### Security Considerations

[Describe any security implications of the architectural decisions made. Include any threat models, mitigations, or requirements.]

### Maintainability Considerations

[Describe how these decisions affect the maintainability of the codebase. Consider code organization, testing, documentation, etc.]

### Scalability Considerations

[Describe how these decisions affect the scalability of the system. Consider load, growth, resource usage, etc.]

## Future Considerations

[List any areas that were identified during decision-making but deferred for future consideration. These might become technical debt or future sprint opportunities.]
