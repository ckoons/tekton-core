# Documentation Requirements for Tekton Development Sprints

This document outlines the documentation requirements for Tekton Development Sprints. It provides guidelines on which documentation must be created or updated as part of a sprint, ensuring that Tekton's documentation remains comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date.

## Overview

Documentation is a critical deliverable for every Development Sprint. Well-maintained documentation ensures that:

- New features are properly documented for users
- Code changes are understandable for future developers
- Architectural decisions are preserved for reference
- The system's design and behavior are accurately described

Each Development Sprint must address documentation as an integral part of the implementation process, not as an afterthought.

## Documentation Categories

Documentation updates are classified into three categories:

1. **MUST Update**: Documentation that must be updated as part of the sprint
2. **CAN Update**: Documentation that can be updated if relevant
3. **CANNOT Update without Approval**: Documentation requiring approval before changes

### MUST Update Documentation

The following documentation **must** be updated as part of any sprint that affects the relevant areas:

- **Component-specific documentation** for any modified components
- **API references** for any changed APIs
- **User guides** for new features or changed behavior
- **Code comments** for new or modified code
- **README files** for affected components
- **Setup instructions** if installation or configuration changes
- **Sprint-specific documentation** (plans, status reports, retrospectives)

### CAN Update Documentation

The following documentation **can** be updated if the sprint touches relevant areas:

- **Development guides** with new patterns or practices
- **Best practices** documentation
- **Examples and tutorials**
- **Troubleshooting guides**
- **Performance considerations**
- **Security guidelines**
- **Component integration examples**

### CANNOT Update without Approval

The following documentation **cannot** be updated without explicit approval from Casey:

- **Architecture overview**
- **Project roadmap**
- **Core design principles**
- **Project governance**
- **Overall project README**
- **License information**
- **Contribution guidelines**

## Required Sprint Documentation

Every Development Sprint must produce the following documentation:

### Planning Phase Documents

1. **SprintPlan.md**
   - Overview of sprint goals and objectives
   - High-level approach
   - Expected outcomes
   - Timeline and phases

2. **ArchitecturalDecisions.md**
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Alternatives considered
   - Decision rationale
   - Technical implications

3. **ImplementationPlan.md**

   - Specific changes to be made
   - Testing approach
   - Phasing if applicable
   - Documentation requirements

4. **ClaudeCodePrompt.md**
   - Initial prompt for Working Claude
   - Specific instructions and requirements
   - References to other documentation

### Implementation Phase Documents

1. **StatusReport.md**
   - Completed tasks
   - Current progress
   - Challenges encountered
   - Next steps
   - Any deviations from the implementation plan

2. **NextPhaseInstructions.md** (if multiple phases)
   - Detailed instructions for the next phase
   - Current state description
   - Remaining work
   - Known issues or challenges

### Completion Phase Documents

1. **FinalStatusReport.md**
   - Summary of all completed work
   - Overview of all changes made
   - Testing results
   - Documentation updates completed
   - Any known limitations or issues

2. **Retrospective.md**
   - What went well
   - What could be improved
   - Lessons learned
   - Suggestions for future sprints
   - Identified technical debt or future work

## Documentation Standards

All documentation should adhere to the following standards:

1. **Markdown Format**: Use GitHub-flavored Markdown for all documentation
2. **Clear Structure**: Use appropriate headings and sections
3. **Comprehensive**: Cover all relevant aspects of the implementation
4. **Accurate**: Ensure all information is correct and up-to-date
5. **Concise**: Be clear and direct without unnecessary verbosity
6. **Cross-Referenced**: Link to related documentation where appropriate
7. **Illustrative**: Include diagrams, code examples, and screenshots as needed

## Documentation Update Process

When updating documentation as part of a sprint:

1. **Identify affected documentation**:
   - Review the Implementation Plan's documentation requirements
   - Identify any additional documentation that should be updated

2. **Create or update documentation**:
   - Make changes to existing documentation
   - Create new documentation as needed
   - Ensure all documentation is consistent

3. **Review documentation**:
   - Verify accuracy and completeness
   - Check for consistency with other documentation
   - Ensure adherence to documentation standards

4. **Document updates in status reports**:
   - List all documentation that was updated
   - Highlight significant changes
   - Note any documentation that still needs updating

## Technical Documentation Types

### Code Documentation

1. **Code Comments**:
   - Add descriptive comments for complex code sections
   - Document public APIs with clear parameter and return descriptions
   - Include usage examples for non-obvious functionality

2. **README Files**:
   - Update component README files with changes to usage, configuration, or behavior
   - Include examples of new functionality
   - Note any breaking changes

3. **API Documentation**:
   - Update API references for any changed APIs
   - Document new endpoints, parameters, or return values
   - Provide usage examples

### User Documentation

1. **User Guides**:
   - Update guides to reflect new features or changed behavior
   - Add sections for new functionality
   - Revise outdated information

2. **Installation and Setup**:
   - Update setup instructions if configuration options change
   - Document new dependencies or requirements
   - Update troubleshooting information

3. **Tutorials and Examples**:
   - Create or update tutorials for new features
   - Ensure examples reflect current behavior

### Architectural Documentation

1. **Component Documentation**:
   - Update component descriptions
   - Document interactions with other components
   - Explain design decisions

2. **Architectural Decisions**:
