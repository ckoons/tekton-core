# [Sprint Name] - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the [Sprint Name] Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on [brief description of the focus area].

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **[Goal 1]**: [Brief description]
2. **[Goal 2]**: [Brief description]
3. **[Goal 3]**: [Brief description]

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- [Value proposition 1]
- [Value proposition 2]
- [Value proposition 3]

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

[Describe the current state of the system in the relevant areas. Highlight any issues, limitations, or technical debt that this sprint will address.]

### Pain Points

[List specific pain points or limitations in the current implementation that this sprint will address.]

## Proposed Approach

[Provide a high-level description of the approach that will be taken to achieve the sprint goals. Outline the major components or areas that will be affected.]

### Key Components Affected

- **[Component 1]**: [How it will be affected]
- **[Component 2]**: [How it will be affected]
- **[Component 3]**: [How it will be affected]

### Technical Approach

[Describe the technical approach at a high level. Include any major patterns, technologies, or techniques that will be used.]

## Code Quality Requirements

### Debug Instrumentation

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md):

- Frontend JavaScript must use conditional `TektonDebug` calls
- Backend Python must use the `debug_log` utility and `@log_function` decorators
- All debug calls must include appropriate component names and log levels
- Error handling must include contextual debug information

This instrumentation will enable efficient debugging and diagnostics without impacting performance when disabled.

### Documentation

Code must be documented according to the following guidelines:

- Class and method documentation with clear purpose statements
- API contracts and parameter descriptions
- Requirements for component initialization
- Error handling strategy

### Testing

The implementation must include appropriate tests:

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths

- [Out of scope item 3]

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- [Dependency 1]
- [Dependency 2]
- [Dependency 3]
