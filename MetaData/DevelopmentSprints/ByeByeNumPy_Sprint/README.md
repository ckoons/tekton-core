# ByeByeNumPy Development Sprint

## Overview

This Development Sprint focuses on eliminating NumPy/SciPy dependencies from Tekton components to resolve compatibility issues and improve system reliability. The sprint addresses NumPy 1.x/2.x compatibility conflicts that are preventing successful component launches, particularly affecting Ergon and Apollo.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This sprint ensures all components can launch successfully by removing problematic machine learning dependencies while preserving functionality through pure Python implementations.

## Sprint Documents

The following documents define this sprint:

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): Outlines the high-level goals, approach, and timeline
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Provides detailed implementation tasks and phases
- [Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Working Claude

## Sprint Branch

This sprint uses the branch `sprint/Clean_Slate_051125`.

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Dependency Elimination Over Management**: Remove problematic dependencies rather than managing version conflicts
2. **Functionality Preservation**: Maintain all existing functionality through pure Python implementations
3. **Performance Optimization**: Leverage dependency removal to improve startup times and memory usage
4. **System Reliability**: Ensure all components can launch successfully without compatibility issues
5. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clean separation of concerns while removing dependencies
6. **Progressive Refactoring**: Systematic approach to dependency removal with thorough testing

## Problem Statement

Current issues preventing successful component launches:

### NumPy Compatibility Conflicts
- NumPy 2.x vs 1.x compiled module incompatibilities
- Ergon crashes on startup due to embedding service dependencies
- Apollo crashes due to statistical computation dependencies

### Component Launch Failures
- `tekton-launch --launch-all` fails for Ergon and Apollo
- ImportError exceptions prevent proper component initialization
- Dependency version conflicts cascade through the system

## Success Criteria

1. **Complete NumPy Elimination**: Remove all NumPy/SciPy dependencies from Ergon and Apollo
2. **Functional Preservation**: All existing functionality maintained through pure Python implementations
3. **Successful Launch**: `tekton-launch --launch-all` completes without NumPy-related errors
4. **Performance Improvement**: Faster startup times and reduced memory footprint
5. **Future-Proof Architecture**: Dependency-free implementations that won't suffer from compatibility issues

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Ergon Refactoring
- Replace scikit-learn with pure Python implementations
- Implement custom embedding similarity calculations
- Replace NumPy arrays with Python lists and built-in math operations

### Phase 2: Apollo Refactoring
- Replace NumPy statistical functions with Python statistics module
- Implement custom mathematical operations using built-in functions
- Replace array operations with list comprehensions and generator expressions

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- Comprehensive testing to ensure functionality preservation
- Performance benchmarking to validate improvements
- System integration testing with all components

## Files Modified

This sprint will modify components in:
- `/Ergon/` - Agent coordination and embedding services
- `/Apollo/` - Executive coordination and predictive planning
- Related configuration and requirements files

## Dependencies to Remove

- `numpy`
- `scipy` 
- `scikit-learn`
- Any transitively dependent packages

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: Ergon dependency elimination (1-2 sessions)
- **Phase 2**: Apollo dependency elimination (1 session)  
- **Phase 3**: Testing and validation (1 session)

Total estimated effort: 3-4 Claude Code sessions
