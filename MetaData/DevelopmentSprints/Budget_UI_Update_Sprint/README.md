# Budget UI Update Sprint

This sprint is focused on updating the existing Budget UI component to fully integrate with the new Budget backend component that was developed during the Budget Consolidation Sprint. The updates will maintain the current UI layout structure with the RIGHT PANEL, HEADER, MENU BAR, and FOOTER sections while enhancing functionality to support the new Budget CLI and API/MCP services.

## Sprint Objectives

1. Update the Budget component UI to connect to the new Budget backend service
2. Implement real-time data fetching and display using the Budget API endpoints
3. Update the two existing chat tabs to utilize the Budget LLM assistant capabilities
4. Enhance UI components to display and control the token/cost management features
5. Integrate with the Budget CLI for advanced operations and commands
6. Update UI settings to configure all Budget component features
7. Ensure the component works with the Single Port Architecture
