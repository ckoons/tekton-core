# Architectural Decisions for Budget UI Update

This document outlines the key architectural decisions for updating the Budget UI component to integrate with the new Budget backend.

## Decision 1: API Client Implementation

**Decision**: Implement a dedicated BudgetApiClient class in the UI component rather than using a shared library.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Use a shared API client library for all Tekton components
2. Directly make fetch/AJAX calls within component methods
3. Implement a dedicated API client specific to the Budget component

**Rationale**:
- Dedicated client allows fine-tuning for specific Budget API needs
- Maintains component independence and encapsulation
- Easier to implement caching and error handling specific to Budget data
- Avoids version conflicts with shared libraries
- Consistent with other self-contained Tekton UI components

**Implications**:
- Need to maintain Budget-specific API client code
- May duplicate some code that exists in other components
- Component remains functional even if central libraries change

## Decision 2: Data Flow Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a unidirectional data flow using a state management pattern for the Budget UI.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Two-way data binding directly to DOM elements
2. Event-based updates with multiple data sources
3. Unidirectional data flow with centralized state

**Rationale**:
- Provides predictable data updates
- Makes testing and debugging easier
- Reduces unexpected side-effects when updating UI elements
- Aligns with modern frontend architecture patterns

**Implications**:
- Requires additional state management code
- All updates must flow through the central state
- Need to implement action handlers for all data changes

## Decision 3: Chat Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Connect Budget chat tabs to the Budget LLM assistant via dedicated WebSocket connection to the Budget MCP service.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Use Hermes as intermediary for all chat communication
2. Connect directly to Rhetor for LLM capabilities
3. Dedicated WebSocket connection to Budget MCP service

**Rationale**:
- Direct connection to Budget service ensures specialized handling
- Budget LLM assistant has domain-specific capabilities for budget optimization
- Allows specialized chat features for budget analysis
- Reduces latency by avoiding intermediaries

**Implications**:
- Need to implement WebSocket handling in the UI
- Must handle connection errors and reconnection logic
- Requires state synchronization with other chat services

## Decision 4: CLI Command Integration

**Decision**: Implement a command parser and executor in the Budget UI to handle CLI commands directly in the chat interface.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Send all commands to the backend for parsing and execution
2. Create a separate CLI command panel outside of chat
3. UI-based command parser with backend execution

**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback for command syntax
- Reduces unnecessary network traffic for simple operations
- Better user experience with autocompletion and inline help
- Follows pattern used by Terma component

**Implications**:
- UI needs to understand command syntax for validation
- Need to maintain command documentation in both UI and backend
- Some commands still require backend execution for data changes

## Decision 5: Real-time Data Updates

**Decision**: Use a combination of polling and WebSocket updates for different types of budget data.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Pure polling-based updates for all data
2. Pure WebSocket for all real-time updates
3. Hybrid approach with polling for non-critical data and WebSocket for important updates

**Rationale**:
- Critical alerts and threshold notifications need immediate updates (WebSocket)
- Usage statistics can use polling to reduce connection overhead
- Matches the importance and frequency of different data types
- Optimizes performance while maintaining responsiveness for critical information

**Implications**:
- More complex implementation with multiple data fetch mechanisms
- Need to manage WebSocket connection states
- Must handle synchronization between polling and WebSocket data

## Decision 6: UI Component Structure Preservation

**Decision**: Maintain the current Budget UI component structure with RIGHT PANEL, HEADER, MENU BAR, and FOOTER while updating the JavaScript implementation.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Redesign the UI with a new structure
2. Create a completely new component with different layout
3. Preserve existing structure while updating functionality

**Rationale**:
- Maintains consistency with existing UI
- Reduces risk of introducing UI bugs
- Focuses development effort on backend integration rather than redesign
- Preserves user familiarity with the interface

**Implications**:
- Limited opportunity for UX improvements in this sprint
- May need to work around existing UI constraints
- Will need to carefully update code while preserving structure

## Decision 7: Settings Management

**Decision**: Implement client-side validation and preview for settings with explicit save action to the backend.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Auto-save settings as they change
2. Batch update all settings at once
3. Settings preview with explicit save action

**Rationale**:
- Provides users with chance to review changes before applying
- Reduces API calls for transient settings changes
- Allows validation of interdependent settings before saving
- Prevents accidental settings changes

**Implications**:
- Need to implement preview mode for settings changes
- Have to track original settings state for comparison
- Must implement complete validation client-side

## Decision 8: Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Implement centralized error handling with contextual user feedback that doesn't interrupt workflow.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Generic error popups
2. Silent failures with console logging only
3. Contextual inline error messaging with recovery options

**Rationale**:
- Provides better user experience with non-blocking errors
- Gives clear guidance on how to resolve issues
- Maintains context of what operation failed
- Consistent with Tekton error handling patterns

**Implications**:
- More complex error handling implementation
- Need to create appropriate error messages for each operation
- Must implement recovery paths for common failures
