# Fix Metis Sprint Plan

## Sprint Overview

**Sprint Name:** Fix Metis Sprint  
**Duration:** 1 day (4-6 hours)  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Rhetor (for LLM access)  

## Background

Metis was originally conceived as an intelligent task decomposition system that would:
- Take high-level requirements and break them down into actionable tasks
- Use AI to analyze complexity and suggest optimal task ordering
- Create linear execution paths from complex dependency graphs
- Handle one-to-many task splits intelligently

However, the current implementation is just a basic CRUD task manager without any AI capabilities.

## Objectives

1. **Add AI-powered task decomposition**
   - Implement automatic breaking down of high-level tasks into subtasks
   - Support configurable decomposition depth
   - Generate meaningful task descriptions and metadata

2. **Implement intelligent complexity analysis**
   - Replace manual scoring with AI-driven analysis
   - Consider technical factors, dependencies, and scope
   - Provide complexity justifications

3. **Create smart task ordering**
   - Analyze dependencies to suggest optimal execution order
   - Identify parallelizable tasks
   - Create linear execution paths where possible

4. **Implement MCP tools**
   - Fill in the placeholder tool implementations
   - Provide comprehensive task manipulation capabilities
   - Enable AI agents to interact with Metis effectively

## Scope

### In Scope
- Adding LLM integration via Rhetor
- Implementing task decomposition engine
- Creating AI-powered complexity analysis
- Implementing MCP tools
- Adding new API endpoints for AI features
- Creating prompt templates for task analysis

### Out of Scope
- Modifying existing CRUD operations
- Changing the data models
- Altering storage mechanisms
- UI development
- Integration with other components (beyond Rhetor)

## Technical Approach

1. **Parallel Development**
   - Add AI features alongside existing functionality
   - Don't modify working code unless necessary
   - New endpoints complement existing ones

2. **Modular Architecture**
   - Separate AI logic into dedicated modules
   - Clean interfaces between AI and existing code
   - Easy to test and maintain

3. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Create specialized prompts for different task types
   - Use structured output formats
   - Include examples for consistency

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Risk:** Breaking existing functionality
   - **Mitigation:** Add new code without modifying existing
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing before integration

2. **Risk:** Poor AI performance
   - **Mitigation:** Iterative prompt refinement
   - **Mitigation:** Fallback to manual operations

3. **Risk:** Integration issues with Rhetor
   - **Mitigation:** Use standard Tekton LLM adapter pattern
   - **Mitigation:** Implement retry logic and error handling

## Success Metrics

1. Can decompose a high-level task into 5-10 meaningful subtasks
2. AI complexity scores align with human judgment 80%+ of the time
3. Generated task orders are executable without manual intervention
4. MCP tools pass integration tests
5. No regression in existing functionality

## Timeline

**Phase 1: Setup and Planning (1 hour)**
- Review existing code structure
- Set up development environment
- Create module skeletons

**Phase 2: Core Implementation (3 hours)**
- Implement LLM adapter
- Create task decomposer
- Build complexity analyzer
- Implement MCP tools

**Phase 3: Integration and Testing (1-2 hours)**
- Wire up new endpoints
- Test AI features
- Verify existing functionality
- Document usage

## Deliverables

1. Working task decomposition via API
2. AI-powered complexity analysis
3. Implemented MCP tools
4. Updated API documentation
5. Example usage scripts
6. Test suite for new features
