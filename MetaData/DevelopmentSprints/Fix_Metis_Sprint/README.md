# Fix Metis Sprint

## Overview

This sprint addresses the missing AI/LLM capabilities in the Metis component. Currently, Metis functions as a basic task management system without the intelligent task decomposition features that are essential to its role in the Tekton ecosystem.

## Sprint Goal

Transform Metis from a "dumb" task tracker into the intelligent task decomposition brain of Tekton by adding AI-powered task breakdown, complexity analysis, and orchestration capabilities.

## Key Findings

During investigation, we discovered that Metis:
- Has a solid infrastructure (API, models, storage, WebSocket)
- Completely lacks AI/LLM integration
- Has placeholder MCP tools that are not implemented
- Uses manual complexity scoring instead of AI analysis
- Cannot decompose tasks or generate subtasks automatically

## Success Criteria

1. Metis can automatically decompose high-level tasks into subtasks using AI
2. Complexity analysis is performed by AI, not manual scoring
3. Task ordering and dependencies are intelligently suggested
4. MCP tools are fully implemented for task operations
5. Integration with Rhetor for all LLM operations

## Approach

This is NOT a complete rewrite. We will:
- Keep all existing infrastructure
- Add AI capabilities alongside existing CRUD operations
- Implement the missing "brain" while preserving the working "skeleton"

## Sprint Duration

Estimated: 1 day (4-6 hours of focused development)
