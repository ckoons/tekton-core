# StreamlineImprovements - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made during the StreamlineImprovements Development Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The architectural decisions in this document focus on reducing technical debt, improving code consistency, and establishing sustainable development patterns.

## Decision 1: Pydantic V3 Direct Migration

### Context

Tekton components currently use a mix of Pydantic v1 and v2 patterns, causing persistent warnings ("Field name 'schema' shadows an attribute in parent 'BaseModel'") and compatibility issues. We need to standardize on a single version.

### Decision

Migrate directly to Pydantic v3 (latest stable release) rather than standardizing on v2.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Standardize on Pydantic v2

Migrate all components to Pydantic v2.x, which is currently more widely adopted.

**Pros:**
- More ecosystem support currently
- Smaller migration from existing v2 patterns
- Well-documented migration guides available

**Cons:**
- Will need another migration to v3 soon
- Still has some v1 compatibility issues
- Doesn't solve all field shadowing warnings

#### Alternative 2: Maintain Compatibility Layer

Create a compatibility layer supporting both v1 and v2 patterns.

**Pros:**
- No immediate migration needed
- Components can upgrade at their own pace
- Lower risk of breaking changes

**Cons:**
- Increases complexity
- Perpetuates inconsistency
- Performance overhead
- Doesn't solve underlying issues

### Decision Rationale

Direct migration to v3 was chosen because:
- Avoids multiple migrations (v1→v2→v3)
- Provides access to latest performance improvements (5-50x faster)
- Solves all field shadowing issues with new ConfigDict pattern
- Aligns with Python ecosystem direction
- One-time pain for long-term gain

### Implications

- **Performance**: Significant validation speed improvements
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner, more consistent codebase
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to learn v3 patterns
- **Dependencies**: Some third-party libraries may need updates
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage required during migration

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Use `ConfigDict` for all model configuration
2. Replace `@validator` with `@field_validator`
3. Use field aliases to avoid BaseModel attribute conflicts
4. Leverage v3's improved type inference
5. Update all import statements to use v3 patterns

## Decision 2: Centralized Shared Utilities

### Context

Significant code duplication exists across components (30-40%), particularly for logging setup, MCP registration, health checks, and error handling. This duplication increases maintenance burden and inconsistency.

### Decision

Create a centralized shared utilities library in `tekton-core/tekton/shared/` that all components import.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Separate Shared Package

Create a new `tekton-shared` package that components depend on.

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Versioned dependency management
- Could be open-sourced separately

**Cons:**
- More complex deployment
- Version synchronization issues
- Extra package to maintain

#### Alternative 2: Copy-Paste Templates

Maintain template files that developers copy into new components.

**Pros:**
- Components remain self-contained
- No runtime dependencies
- Simple to understand

**Cons:**
- Perpetuates duplication
- Updates require manual propagation
- Inconsistency inevitable

### Decision Rationale

Centralized utilities in tekton-core chosen because:
- Single source of truth for common patterns
- Easy import path (`from tekton.shared.logging import setup_logger`)
- Updates propagate automatically
- Reduces codebase by 30-40%
- Part of existing core infrastructure

### Implications

- **Maintainability**: Fix once, benefit everywhere
- **Dependencies**: All components depend on tekton-core
- **Testing**: Shared utilities need comprehensive tests
- **Documentation**: Clear usage examples required
- **Performance**: Potential for optimized implementations

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Create modular utility files (logging.py, mcp.py, etc.)
2. Provide both simple and advanced usage patterns
3. Include deprecation helpers for migration
4. Document all utilities with examples
5. Version utilities to track changes

## Decision 3: API Versioning from Start

### Context

Components currently expose APIs without versioning, making backward-incompatible changes risky. We need a sustainable approach to API evolution.

### Decision

Implement API versioning with `/api/v1/` prefix from the beginning for all component endpoints.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: No Versioning Initially

Start without versioning and add it when needed.

**Pros:**
- Simpler URLs initially
- Less overhead to implement
- Can add versioning later

**Cons:**
- Breaking changes affect all clients
- Difficult to add versioning retroactively
- No clear upgrade path

#### Alternative 2: Header-Based Versioning

Use HTTP headers (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.tekton.v1+json`) for versioning.

**Pros:**
- URLs remain clean
- Industry standard for some APIs
- Flexible versioning strategies

**Cons:**
- More complex to implement
- Harder to test and debug
- Not visible in URLs

### Decision Rationale

URL-based versioning chosen because:
- Clear and visible in all contexts
- Easy to implement and test
- Standard practice for REST APIs
- Supports multiple versions simultaneously
- Simple client implementation

### Implications

- **URLs**: All endpoints prefixed with version
- **Routing**: Version-aware routing required
- **Documentation**: Version-specific API docs
- **Deprecation**: Clear path for removing old versions
- **Client Updates**: Clients must include version in URLs

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Use `/api/v1/` prefix for all endpoints
2. Create version-specific routers in FastAPI
3. Document version differences clearly
4. Plan deprecation timeline for old versions
5. Support at least N-1 versions

## Decision 4: Import Structure Standards

### Context

Import complexity and circular dependencies cause startup failures and make the codebase difficult to navigate. We need clear import patterns and module boundaries.

### Decision

Establish strict import standards: relative imports within components, absolute imports across components, with explicit module boundaries defined by `__init__.py` exports.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: All Absolute Imports

Use only absolute imports throughout the codebase.

**Pros:**
- Very explicit about source
- No ambiguity about import origin
- Easier refactoring

**Cons:**
- Verbose import statements
- Harder to move components
- Less flexible component structure

#### Alternative 2: All Relative Imports

Use relative imports everywhere possible.

**Pros:**
- Components are self-contained
- Easy to move components
- Shorter import statements

**Cons:**
- Can be confusing (how many dots?)
- Cross-component imports unclear
- Harder to understand dependencies

### Decision Rationale

Mixed approach chosen because:
- Clear distinction between internal and external
- Components remain moveable units
- Dependencies are explicit
- Prevents most circular import issues
- Follows Python community practices

### Implications

- **Code Organization**: Clear module boundaries required
- **Refactoring**: Easier to identify dependencies
- **Testing**: Clear mocking boundaries
- **Performance**: Potential for lazy imports
- **Tooling**: Linters can enforce standards

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Use relative imports within component boundaries
2. Use absolute imports for cross-component
3. Define all exports in `__init__.py`
4. Avoid deep import chains
5. Use lazy imports for heavy dependencies

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Considerations

- Pydantic v3 provides 5-50x validation performance improvement
- Shared utilities enable optimized implementations
- Lazy imports reduce startup time
- Standard patterns enable profiling and optimization

### Security Considerations

- Centralized error handling prevents information leakage
- Standard validation patterns reduce attack surface
- Consistent authentication/authorization patterns
- Audit logging in shared utilities

### Maintainability Considerations

- 30-40% code reduction improves maintainability
- Single source of truth for common patterns
- Clear module boundaries aid understanding
- Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load

### Scalability Considerations

- Versioned APIs support gradual migrations
- Shared utilities can be optimized centrally
- Clean imports reduce memory overhead
- Standard patterns enable horizontal scaling

## Future Considerations

1. **Automated Migration Tools**: Scripts to help migrate components to new patterns
2. **Component Generator**: Template system using shared utilities
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Built into shared utilities
4. **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and routing
5. **Schema Registry**: Centralized schema management for Pydantic models
