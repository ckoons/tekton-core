# Import Simplification Sprint - CANCELLED

## Status: CANCELLED (2025-06-05)

This sprint has been cancelled and superseded by the ImportTuneUp_Sprint.

## Cancellation Reason

The sprint approach was fundamentally flawed:

1. **Lack of Problem Definition**: Started making changes without properly identifying and measuring actual problems
2. **Mechanical Changes Over Solutions**: Focused on cosmetic changes (logger names) rather than solving real import issues
3. **No Measurement Methodology**: No baseline metrics or success criteria beyond vague percentages
4. **Poor Execution**: Created breaking changes by adding imports without verifying they existed

## Work Attempted

- Created `shared/utils/import_helpers.py` (reverted)
- Changed logger names in ~100 files (reverted)
- Attempted to add module exports that didn't exist (reverted)
- Fixed one star import in Prometheus (reverted)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Measure First**: Use proper tooling (pylint, pydeps, import-linter) to identify real problems
2. **Define Success**: Clear metrics and specific problems to solve
3. **Test Incrementally**: Verify each change works before proceeding
4. **Focus on Impact**: Fix actual failures, not theoretical improvements

## Superseded By

ImportTuneUp_Sprint will take a periodic maintenance approach using:
- Automated analysis tools
- Regular import health reports
- Targeted fixes for measured problems
- Clear before/after metrics

## Original Sprint Documentation

The original sprint documentation remains in README.md for reference, but should not be used for future work.
