# Engram Simplification Sprint

## Overview

This sprint focuses on dramatically simplifying the Engram memory system by consolidating multiple APIs, removing experimental features, and creating a clean, intuitive interface for AI memory operations.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Reduce API Surface**: Consolidate 5+ different interfaces into one simple API
2. **Remove Complexity**: Cut experimental features that add noise without value
3. **Silent Operation**: Make Engram quiet by default, verbose only when debugging
4. **Clear Documentation**: Document what actually exists, not what we dream of

## Current State

Engram currently has:
- 5 different APIs (REST, MCP, FastMCP, CLI, Cognitive)
- Multiple overlapping storage layers
- Extensive logging that drowns out actual results
- Many partially-implemented experimental features
- Documentation that describes aspirations rather than reality

## Target State

A simple, reliable memory system with:
- One Memory class with 3 methods: `store()`, `recall()`, `context()`
- Silent operation by default
- Clear, accurate documentation
- Preserved core functionality that other components depend on

## Sprint Structure

### Phase 1: Consolidate & Clean
- Create new simplified API
- Remove experimental features
- Consolidate storage layers

### Phase 2: Migration
- Update components to use new API
- Ensure backward compatibility where critical
- Update tests

### Phase 3: Documentation
- Rewrite docs to match implementation
- Create simple quickstart guide
- Document migration path

## Success Criteria

- Engram can be used with 5 lines of code
- No logs appear unless ENGRAM_DEBUG is set
- All existing Tekton components continue to work
- Documentation accurately reflects implementation
