# FastMCP Integration - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made during the FastMCP Integration Development Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The architectural decisions in this document focus on integrating FastMCP with Tekton to enhance its MCP capabilities.

## Decision 1: Direct Replacement vs. Adaptation Layer

### Context

When integrating FastMCP with Tekton, we needed to decide whether to replace Tekton's existing MCP implementation entirely or build an adaptation layer that would maintain compatibility with the existing code.

### Decision

We will directly replace Tekton's custom MCP implementation with FastMCP, focusing on a clean, forward-looking architecture rather than maintaining backward compatibility.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Direct Replacement

**Pros:**
- Cleaner implementation without legacy compatibility code
- Full access to all FastMCP features without compromise
- Simpler mental model for developers using the system
- Better performance without adaptation overhead

**Cons:**
- Requires updating all components that use MCP
- Potentially disruptive to existing workflows
- Migration effort higher in the short term

#### Alternative 2: Adaptation Layer

**Pros:**
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Allows gradual migration of components
- Lower initial disruption

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- Potential performance overhead
- May not expose all FastMCP features
- Technical debt and maintenance burden

### Decision Rationale

Since we don't need to maintain backward compatibility, a direct replacement approach provides a cleaner architecture and better long-term maintainability. This decision allows us to fully leverage FastMCP's features without compromise and establishes a more sustainable foundation for future development.

### Implications

- All components using MCP will need to be updated to use FastMCP
- Documentation will need to be updated to reflect the new approach
- Training may be required for developers to understand the new patterns
- The codebase will be cleaner and more consistent

### Implementation Guidelines

- Remove the existing MCP implementation entirely rather than maintaining both
- Create clear migration examples for component owners
- Establish standardized patterns for FastMCP usage in Tekton
- Implement the changes component by component to manage complexity

## Decision 2: Component MCP Server Architecture

### Context

We needed to decide how to structure MCP servers within Tekton's component architecture, considering options ranging from a single centralized server to fully distributed servers for each component.

### Decision

Each Tekton component will have its own FastMCP server that can operate independently but can also be composed through mounting into a unified MCP interface.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Centralized MCP Server

**Pros:**
- Single interface for all Tekton functionality
- Simplified discovery and connection management
- Centralized monitoring and administration

**Cons:**
- Tight coupling between components
- Single point of failure
- Scalability challenges
- Harder to develop and test components in isolation

#### Alternative 2: Component-Specific MCP Servers

**Pros:**
- Loose coupling between components
- Independent development and testing
- Better scalability and fault isolation
- Aligns with Tekton's microservice architecture

**Cons:**
- More complex discovery mechanism needed
- Potential duplication of common functionality
- Multiple connection points for clients

#### Alternative 3: Hybrid Approach with Composition

**Pros:**
- Components have independent servers but can be composed
- Flexibility to use either individual services or a unified interface
- Preserves loose coupling while enabling centralized access
- Leverages FastMCP's mounting capability

**Cons:**
- More complex architecture
- Requires consistent naming conventions
- Needs coordination for prefix management

### Decision Rationale

The hybrid approach with composition (Alternative 3) provides the best balance between component independence and integrated experience. It leverages FastMCP's mounting feature to create composed interfaces while maintaining the benefits of loose coupling between components.

### Implications

- Each Tekton component will have its own FastMCP server
- Components can be used independently or composed together
- Naming conventions and prefixing will be important for composition
- Discovery mechanism will need to support both independent and composed modes

### Implementation Guidelines

- Create a standard base class for component MCP servers
- Establish consistent naming conventions for tools and resources
- Implement common mounting patterns in Hermes
- Create utilities to help with server discovery and composition

## Decision 3: Claude Code Integration Approach

### Context

Tekton needs to integrate with Claude Code to enable AI-assisted development. We needed to determine the best approach for exposing Tekton's functionality to Claude Code using FastMCP.

### Decision

Implement a standardized "Claude Code bridge" utility in Tekton that enables any component's FastMCP server to be easily exposed to Claude Code using FastMCP's installation mechanism.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Manual Server Setup for Claude Code

**Pros:**
- Direct control over what's exposed to Claude Code
- No additional abstraction layers

**Cons:**
- Requires manual configuration for each component
- Inconsistent experience across components
- Higher barrier to entry for component developers

#### Alternative 2: Standardized Claude Code Bridge

**Pros:**
- Consistent pattern across all components
- Simplified experience for component developers
- Centralized management of Claude Code integration
- Reusable code for common patterns

**Cons:**
- Additional abstraction layer
- Potential limitations for specialized use cases

#### Alternative 3: Automatic Claude Code Integration

**Pros:**
- Zero configuration for component developers
- Maximum ease of use

**Cons:**
- Less control over what's exposed
- Potential for exposing inappropriate functionality
- May not handle all edge cases

### Decision Rationale

A standardized Claude Code bridge (Alternative 2) provides the best balance between ease of use and control. It ensures consistency across components while still allowing customization when needed.

### Implications

- Component developers will use a standard pattern for Claude Code integration
- Tekton will include utilities for installing FastMCP servers with Claude Code
- Documentation will need to cover Claude Code integration patterns
- Testing will need to verify Claude Code compatibility

### Implementation Guidelines

- Create a `tekton.claude` module with Claude Code integration utilities
- Implement functions for installing FastMCP servers with Claude Code
- Provide examples of proper usage in documentation
- Develop testing patterns for Claude Code integration

## Decision 4: Client-Side MCP Sampling Integration

### Context

FastMCP offers a powerful client-side sampling feature that allows MCP servers to request completions from connected LLM clients. We needed to decide how to integrate this feature into Tekton's architecture.

### Decision

Implement a standardized pattern for leveraging FastMCP's client-side sampling across Tekton components, enabling seamless bidirectional communication with LLMs.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: No Sampling Integration

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation
- Fewer dependencies

**Cons:**
- Missing a powerful capability
- Limited bidirectional communication
- Reduced AI integration potential

#### Alternative 2: Component-Specific Sampling

**Pros:**
- Each component can implement sampling as needed
- More flexibility for specialized cases

**Cons:**
- Inconsistent implementation across components
- Duplication of effort
- Harder to maintain

#### Alternative 3: Standardized Sampling Pattern

**Pros:**
- Consistent experience across components
- Reusable code and patterns
- Easier to document and maintain
- Enables advanced AI workflows

**Cons:**
- Requires careful design
- May not fit all specialized use cases

### Decision Rationale

A standardized sampling pattern (Alternative 3) provides the most value by enabling advanced AI workflows consistently across Tekton components. This approach leverages one of FastMCP's most powerful features while maintaining a consistent developer experience.

### Implications

- Tekton will include utilities for client-side sampling
- Components will have access to bidirectional LLM communication
- AI integration capabilities will be enhanced
- Documentation will need to cover sampling patterns and best practices

### Implementation Guidelines

- Create standard sampling utilities in tekton-core
- Develop patterns for common sampling use cases
- Implement examples of sampling in key components
- Document best practices for effective sampling

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Considerations

FastMCP is designed to be efficient, but certain patterns like mounting multiple servers or extensive use of sampling could impact performance. Components should be benchmarked both individually and when composed to ensure acceptable performance characteristics.

### Security Considerations

MCP servers expose functionality that could potentially be misused. Care should be taken to validate inputs, limit exposed functionality to what's necessary, and implement appropriate access controls. FastMCP's roots feature should be leveraged for file system access security.

### Maintainability Considerations

The transition to FastMCP simplifies the codebase by replacing custom MCP implementation with a standardized library. This improves maintainability but requires consistent patterns and documentation to ensure all developers understand how to properly use FastMCP in the Tekton context.

### Scalability Considerations

The component-specific server architecture with composition capability provides good scalability characteristics, allowing components to be deployed and scaled independently while still providing a unified interface when needed.

## Future Considerations

- **FastMCP Web UI Integration**: FastMCP has a web UI component that could be integrated with Tekton's frontend
- **OpenAPI Generation**: FastMCP can generate servers from OpenAPI specs, which could be useful for certain components
- **Database Integration**: Further integration between FastMCP and Tekton's database layer could provide additional capabilities
- **Advanced Sampling Patterns**: As sampling capabilities mature, more sophisticated patterns could be developed
