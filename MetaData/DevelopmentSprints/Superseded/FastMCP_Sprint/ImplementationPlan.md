# FastMCP Integration - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the FastMCP Integration Development Sprint. It breaks down the high-level goals into specific implementation tasks, defines the phasing, specifies testing requirements, and identifies documentation that must be updated.

## Technical Design Details

### Architecture Changes

The integration of FastMCP introduces several architectural changes to Tekton:

1. **Component-Based MCP Servers**: Each Tekton component will have its own FastMCP server
2. **Composition Layer**: Hermes will provide a composition layer for FastMCP servers
3. **Standardized Patterns**: Common patterns for tools, resources, and prompts will be established
4. **Claude Code Bridge**: A standardized approach for Claude Code integration
5. **Sampling Integration**: Bidirectional communication with LLMs through client-side sampling

### Data Model Changes

FastMCP integration primarily affects the API layer rather than the data model. However, there are some considerations:

1. **Tool Registry**: The tool registry in Hermes will need to track FastMCP servers and their capabilities
2. **Resource URI Patterns**: Standardized URI patterns for resources will be established
3. **Prompt Storage**: Prompts defined in FastMCP will need consistent storage and retrieval

### API Changes

FastMCP introduces decorator-based APIs that replace the more verbose function-based APIs:

```python
# Before (function-based API):
register_tool(
    name="my_tool",
    description="Does something",
    function=my_function,
    schema={...},
    tags=["tag1", "tag2"]
)

# After (decorator-based API):
@mcp.tool()
def my_tool(param1: str, param2: int) -> dict:
    """Does something"""
    # Implementation
    return result
```

### User Interface Changes

No direct UI changes are planned for this sprint, but the improvements in the MCP layer will enable future UI enhancements by providing more consistent and powerful tool interfaces.

### Cross-Component Integration

The FastMCP integration enhances cross-component communication through:

1. **Mounted Servers**: Components can discover and mount other components' servers
2. **Standard URI Patterns**: Consistent patterns for resources across components
3. **Common Tool Patterns**: Standard approaches for tool definition and usage
4. **Hermes Registry**: Central registry for discovering component capabilities

## Code Organization

The FastMCP integration will be organized as follows:

```
tekton-core/
├── tekton/
│   ├── mcp/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── fastmcp/
│   │   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   │   ├── base.py        # Base classes
│   │   │   ├── tools.py       # Tool patterns
│   │   │   ├── resources.py   # Resource patterns
│   │   │   ├── prompts.py     # Prompt patterns
│   │   │   └── utils.py       # Utilities
│   │   ├── sampling/
│   │   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   │   └── client.py      # Sampling utilities
│   ├── claude/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── install.py         # Claude Code installation
│   │   └── utils.py           # Claude Code utilities
```

Component implementations will follow a consistent pattern:

```
component/
├── component_name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── mcp_server.py      # FastMCP server
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── [core modules]     # Core functionality
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

Unit tests will cover:
- FastMCP base classes and utilities
- Component-specific FastMCP servers
- Claude Code integration utilities
- Sampling functionality

### Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify:
- Component interoperability through FastMCP
- Composition of multiple FastMCP servers
- End-to-end workflows using multiple components
- Claude Code integration

### System Tests

System tests will cover:
- Complete workflows using all key components
- Performance and scalability with multiple components
- Error handling and recovery scenarios

### Performance Tests

Performance tests will focus on:
- Latency of FastMCP operations
- Throughput with multiple concurrent requests
- Resource usage during normal operation
- Scalability with increasing components

## Documentation Updates

### MUST Update Documentation

The following documentation **must** be updated as part of this sprint:

- **FastMCP Integration Guide**: New document explaining FastMCP integration
- **Component MCP Documentation**: Updates to each component's MCP documentation
- **Developer Guide**: Instructions for building FastMCP-compatible components
- **Claude Code Integration**: Guide for using Tekton with Claude Code

### CAN Update Documentation

The following documentation **can** be updated if relevant:

- **Architecture Overview**: To reflect the new FastMCP architecture
- **Tutorials**: To demonstrate FastMCP usage
- **API References**: To document new FastMCP-based APIs

### CANNOT Update without Approval

The following documentation **cannot** be updated without explicit approval:

- **Project Roadmap**
- **Core Design Principles**

## Deployment Considerations

The FastMCP integration requires careful deployment planning:

1. **Dependencies**: FastMCP and its dependencies must be properly installed
2. **Configuration**: Components need updated configuration for FastMCP servers
3. **Networking**: Port assignments for MCP servers need to be coordinated
4. **Environment Variables**: FastMCP may require specific environment configuration

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with the FastMCP integration, the rollback plan is to revert to the commit before the integration began. Since backward compatibility is not a requirement, we are implementing a clean replacement rather than a parallel implementation.

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

- All key Tekton components have been migrated to use FastMCP
- Component interoperability works through FastMCP
- Claude Code integration functions correctly
- Documentation clearly explains how to use the new capabilities
- Performance meets or exceeds the previous implementation
- Advanced FastMCP features (composability, sampling, etc.) are available
