# FastMCP Integration - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the FastMCP Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Development Sprint focuses on integrating FastMCP, a modern Pythonic framework for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), with Tekton to enhance its tool and agent capabilities.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Modernize MCP Implementation**: Replace Tekton's existing MCP implementation with FastMCP's more elegant, decorator-based approach
2. **Improve Claude Code Integration**: Establish a seamless workflow for using FastMCP-powered Tekton components with Claude Code
3. **Enable Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Leverage FastMCP's client-side capabilities to enhance Tekton's inter-agent communication

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Reducing Development Time**: FastMCP's declarative approach reduces boilerplate code needed for tool definition by 60-80%
- **Enhancing AI Capabilities**: Better integration with Claude Code means more powerful AI-driven development workflows
- **Improving User Experience**: FastMCP's simplified tooling makes Tekton components more accessible to users
- **Enabling Composability**: Components built with FastMCP can be easily combined, mounted, and reused

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

Tekton currently has a custom MCP implementation across several components:

1. **Tekton Core**: Provides basic MCP functionality in `tekton-core/tekton/mcp/` with classes for messages, tool registry, and content processing
2. **Ergon**: Implements MCP client in `Ergon/ergon/core/mcp_client.py` and tool registration in `Ergon/ergon/core/repository/mcp/`
3. **Hermes**: Offers MCP endpoints and database integration for service discovery

The current implementation is functional but requires significant boilerplate code to register and use tools. It also lacks some of the advanced features that FastMCP provides, such as easy server composition, client-side sampling, and simplified resource definitions.

### Pain Points

1. **Verbose Tool Registration**: Current tool registration requires many lines of code and manual schema definition
2. **Limited Resource Definition**: No standardized way to define and use resource URIs
3. **No Decorator API**: Lacks the intuitive decorator-based API that FastMCP offers
4. **Incompatible with Claude Code**: No simple path for using Tekton components directly with Claude Code
5. **Complex Client-Server Integration**: Connecting components requires custom client logic

## Proposed Approach

Since backward compatibility is not a concern, we will implement a clean, forward-looking approach using FastMCP as the primary MCP implementation for Tekton. This involves:

1. **Direct FastMCP Integration**: Replace Tekton's custom MCP code with FastMCP equivalents
2. **Component Migration**: Convert each Tekton component to use FastMCP's decorator-based API
3. **Claude Code Integration**: Create standardized patterns for exposing Tekton components to Claude Code
4. **Client/Server Architecture**: Implement FastMCP's client/server model across Tekton components

### Key Components Affected

- **tekton-core**: Replace existing MCP implementation with FastMCP-based architecture
- **Ergon**: Migrate to FastMCP for tool registration and client capabilities
- **Hermes**: Update to serve as a composition layer for FastMCP servers
- **All components**: Update to expose functionality through FastMCP

### Technical Approach

The technical approach will focus on a clean implementation using FastMCP's native capabilities:

1. **Decorator-First Design**: Prioritize the use of FastMCP's intuitive decorators
2. **Component Servers**: Create dedicated FastMCP servers for each Tekton component
3. **Composition Strategy**: Use FastMCP's mounting and proxying capabilities to combine components
4. **Standardized Patterns**: Develop consistent patterns for resources, tools, and prompts

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- **Legacy Compatibility Layer**: Since backward compatibility is not required
- **UI/UX Development**: Frontend changes to support the new capabilities
- **Non-MCP Components**: Components not directly related to MCP functionality

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- **FastMCP Library**: Requires installation and integration of the FastMCP package
- **Claude Code**: For testing integration with Claude Code MCP capabilities
- **UV Package Manager**: For managing FastMCP installation and integration

## Timeline and Phases

This sprint is planned to be completed in 3 phases:

### Phase 1: Core Implementation
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Implement FastMCP in tekton-core and define standard patterns
- **Key Deliverables**: 
  - FastMCP integration in tekton-core
  - Standard patterns for tools, resources, and prompts
  - Installation and configuration utilities

### Phase 2: Component Migration
- **Duration**: 2-3 days
- **Focus**: Migrate key components to use FastMCP
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Ergon FastMCP implementation
  - Hermes FastMCP integration
  - Component MCP server implementations

### Phase 3: Claude Code Integration and Examples
- **Duration**: 1-2 days
- **Focus**: Finalize Claude Code integration and examples
- **Key Deliverables**:
  - Claude Code MCP server utility
  - End-to-end example workflows
  - Documentation and usage guides

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| FastMCP API changes | Medium | Low | Pin to a specific version and document any workarounds |
| Functionality gaps | High | Medium | Identify gaps early and implement custom extensions if needed |
| Performance concerns | Medium | Low | Benchmark and optimize critical paths |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Use isolation through UV and document requirements |

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- All key Tekton components are migrated to use FastMCP
- Tekton components can be seamlessly exposed to Claude Code via FastMCP
- The implementation leverages FastMCP's advanced features (composability, proxying, etc.)
- Documentation clearly explains how to use the new capabilities
- At least one end-to-end example demonstrates the complete workflow

## Key Stakeholders

- **Casey**: Human-in-the-loop project manager
- **Tekton Component Owners**: Stakeholders for impacted components
- **Claude Code Team**: For validation of Claude Code integration
