# Tekton Native Intelligence Sprint - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Tekton Native Intelligence Development Sprint. It breaks down the high-level goals into specific implementation tasks, defines the phasing, specifies testing requirements, and identifies documentation that must be updated.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This Implementation Plan focuses on creating emergent intelligence through sophisticated component orchestration.

## Debug Instrumentation Requirements

All code produced in this sprint **MUST** follow the [Debug Instrumentation Guidelines](/MetaData/TektonDocumentation/DeveloperGuides/Debugging/DebuggingInstrumentation.md). This section specifies the debug instrumentation requirements for this sprint's implementation.

### JavaScript Components

The following JavaScript components must be instrumented:

| Component | Log Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Intelligence UI Components | INFO | User interactions with native intelligence features |
| Workflow Visualization | DEBUG | Dynamic workflow composition and evolution |
| Context Display | TRACE | Context management and cross-component state |

All instrumentation must use conditional checks:

```javascript
if (window.TektonDebug) TektonDebug.info('nativeIntelligence', 'Orchestrating multi-component workflow', workflowData);
```

### Python Components

The following Python components must be instrumented:

| Component | Log Level | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Orchestration Engine | INFO | Cross-component coordination and decision making |
| Learning Systems | DEBUG | Workflow adaptation and optimization decisions |
| Context Management | DEBUG | Context creation, retrieval, and evolution |
| Predictive Integration | INFO | Apollo integration and prediction utilization |
| Component Composition | DEBUG | Dynamic agent creation and capability matching |

All instrumentation must use the `debug_log` utility:

```python
from shared.debug.debug_utils import debug_log, log_function

debug_log.info("native_intelligence", "Analyzing system capabilities for request", {"request_id": request_id, "components": components})
```

Key methods should use the `@log_function` decorator:

```python
@log_function()
async def orchestrate_multi_component_workflow(workflow_spec, context):
    # Method implementation
```
