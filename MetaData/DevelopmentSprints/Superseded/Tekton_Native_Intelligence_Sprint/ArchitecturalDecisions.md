# Tekton Native Intelligence Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made during the Tekton Native Intelligence Development Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The architectural decisions in this document focus on creating emergent intelligence through sophisticated component orchestration.

## Decision 1: Hermes as Central Orchestration Intelligence Hub

### Context

Native intelligence capabilities require coordination across multiple Tekton components. We need to determine where to implement the orchestration logic and how to manage cross-component reasoning and workflow coordination.

### Decision

We will extend Hermes to serve as the central orchestration intelligence hub, implementing native intelligence capabilities as enhanced MCP tools and A2A coordination services.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Dedicated Intelligence Component

Create a new Tekton component specifically for native intelligence.

**Pros:**
- Clean separation of concerns

- Design for horizontal scaling of orchestration capabilities

## Decision 2: Context-Aware Orchestration Pattern

### Context

Native intelligence requires maintaining context across complex multi-component workflows. We need to determine how to preserve, share, and utilize context intelligently across the system.

### Decision

We will implement a context-aware orchestration pattern that creates unified context objects that can be passed between components, maintains context history in Engram for learning, and provides context-aware decision making in all orchestration tools.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Stateless Orchestration

Keep orchestration stateless and require components to manage their own context.

**Pros:**
- Simpler orchestration logic
- Better fault tolerance
- Easier to scale horizontally

- Provide visibility into learning decisions and changes
- Create rollback mechanisms for problematic adaptations
- Design learning systems that preserve workflow reliability

## Decision 4: Emergent Intelligence Through Component Composition

### Context

The most powerful native intelligence capabilities should emerge from intelligent composition of existing components rather than creating entirely new functionality.

### Decision

We will implement emergent intelligence through sophisticated component composition patterns that combine capabilities in novel ways, create hybrid agents with mixed capabilities, enable dynamic capability discovery and matching, and provide intelligent workflow routing based on capability analysis.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Extend Individual Components

Add intelligence capabilities directly to each component.

- Design composition patterns that maintain individual component autonomy
- Enable dynamic composition based on runtime conditions

## Decision 5: Predictive Intelligence Integration

### Context

Apollo's predictive capabilities represent a unique asset that should be integrated throughout the native intelligence system for proactive optimization and planning.

### Decision

We will integrate predictive intelligence throughout native intelligence capabilities using Apollo's planning engine for workflow optimization, predictive resource allocation and cost management, proactive problem identification and mitigation, and intelligent scheduling and timing optimization.

- Predictive problem prevention
- Adaptive workflow optimization
- Context-aware decision making

Target performance characteristics:
- Orchestration overhead: <100ms for simple operations
- Learning adaptation time: <24 hours for workflow optimization
- Context retrieval: <50ms for typical context sizes
- Prediction latency: <1 second for standard predictions

### Security Considerations

Native intelligence requires enhanced security measures:
- Context access control and encryption
- Secure cross-component communication
- Learning system validation and constraints
- Audit logging of all intelligence decisions
- Prevention of intelligence-based attack vectors

Security implementation must leverage existing Tekton security infrastructure while adding intelligence-specific protections.

### Maintainability Considerations

Native intelligence affects maintainability through:
- Increased system complexity requiring clear documentation
- Learning behaviors that may change over time
- Cross-component dependencies requiring careful coordination
- Context management requiring proper lifecycle handling
- Predictive systems requiring ongoing validation

Documentation and testing strategies must account for the dynamic nature of learning systems.

### Scalability Considerations

Native intelligence must scale with Tekton growth:
- Orchestration hub must handle increasing request volumes
- Context management must scale with user growth
- Learning systems must maintain performance with larger datasets
- Predictive capabilities must handle increasing complexity
- Component composition must support growing capability sets

Architecture must support horizontal scaling of intelligence capabilities.
