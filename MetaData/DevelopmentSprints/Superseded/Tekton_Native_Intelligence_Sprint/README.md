# Tekton Native Intelligence Sprint

This directory contains the documentation and planning artifacts for the Tekton Native Intelligence Sprint, focusing on creating sophisticated orchestration capabilities that leverage Tekton's unique multi-component architecture.

## Overview

The Tekton Native Intelligence Sprint creates capabilities that emerge from intelligent orchestration across multiple AI components. Rather than integrating external tools, this sprint develops "intelligence that emerges from orchestration" - capabilities that are more powerful than the sum of their parts.

## Key Documents

- [Sprint Plan](./SprintPlan.md): High-level overview of the sprint goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](./ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](./ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed implementation tasks and phasing
- [Claude Code Prompt](./ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Claude Code implementation

## Sprint Goals

1. **Multi-Component Reasoning Tools**: MCP tools that orchestrate complex reasoning across components
2. **Adaptive Workflow Intelligence**: A2A workflows that self-optimize based on context and performance
3. **System-Wide Cognitive Capabilities**: Tools that provide insights into Tekton's collective intelligence
4. **Emergent Intelligence Patterns**: Capabilities that arise from component interaction

## Sprint Branches

All development for this sprint should be conducted on the branch:

```
sprint/native-intelligence-250608
```

Working Claude sessions must verify they are on the correct branch before making any changes using:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/native-intelligence-250608
```

## Status and Updates

Status reports and updates will be added to the [StatusReports](./StatusReports) directory as the sprint progresses.

## Core Value Proposition

**"Intelligence that emerges from orchestration"** - creating capabilities that leverage:
- Apollo's predictive planning
- Engram's memory and context
- Budget's cost optimization  
- A2A's multi-agent coordination
- Hermes's service registry and messaging

## Unique Advantages

These capabilities will be:
- **Unique to Tekton**: Literally impossible to implement elsewhere
- **Emergent Intelligence**: More powerful than individual components
- **Self-Improving**: Learn and adapt over time
- **Context-Aware**: Maintain state across complex multi-session workflows
- **Cost-Optimized**: Intelligently manage resources and budgets

## Next Steps

After completing this sprint, the following initiatives are recommended:

1. **Advanced Orchestration Patterns**: Build more sophisticated workflow templates
2. **User Interface Enhancement**: Create UIs for managing intelligent workflows
3. **Third-Party AI Integration**: Extend orchestration to external AI services
4. **Enterprise Intelligence Features**: Advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
