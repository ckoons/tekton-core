# Fix GUI Sprint - Implementation Guidelines

## Important Implementation Notes

### Documentation and Status Updates

1. **All documentation and status updates must be placed in the following directory only:**
   ```
   /Users/cskoons/projects/github/Tekton/MetaData/DevelopmentSprints/Fix_GUI_Sprint/
   ```

2. **Do not modify or create documentation files in any other location.**

3. **Required Status Updates:**
   - Create daily status update files in the format: `Status_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Document all changes made, issues encountered, and decisions taken
   - Include links to modified files and brief descriptions of changes
   - Track progress against the Implementation Plan

4. **Implementation Documentation:**
   - Create implementation notes for each component modified
   - Document all significant changes to architecture
   - Provide clear instructions for testing changes
   - Update existing documentation as needed

### Scope Clarification

1. **This work applies to ALL Tekton components, not just Athena.**
   - The UI standardization applies to every Tekton component UI
   - The chat interface should be added to all component screens
   - Component templates should be usable by all Tekton components
   - Panel layout changes affect all components

2. **Component List (All In Scope):**
   - Athena (Knowledge graph and information retrieval)
   - Engram (Memory and context management)
   - Ergon (Task and workflow management)
   - Hermes (Communication and notification)
   - Rhetor (Natural language generation)
   - Terma (Terminal interface)
   - Telos (Goal and intention management)
   - Budget (Resource management)
   - Tekton Dashboard (System overview and monitoring)
   - Settings (Configuration management)
   - Profile (User profile management)

3. **Exception: Codex is not in scope for this sprint**
   - Do not modify Codex-specific components or interfaces
   - Maintain compatibility with Codex but do not directly change it

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start with Core UI Changes:**
   - Begin with the UI Manager and component loading system
   - Fix the panel layout and navigation first
   - Establish the two-panel layout (LEFT for navigation, RIGHT for content)

2. **Implement Component Templates:**
   - Create standard HTML, JS, and CSS templates
   - Convert one component (e.g., Athena) to the new format
   - Document the template usage clearly

3. **Roll Out to All Components:**
   - Systematically update each component to use the new structure
   - Test each component after modification
   - Document component-specific requirements

4. **Add Chat Interface:**
   - Create the standardized chat interface
   - Add to each component UI
   - Test LLM Adapter integration

## Testing Requirements

1. **Test Every Component:**
   - Each modified component must be tested individually
   - Verify all functionality works as expected
   - Check for cross-component interactions

2. **WebSocket Testing:**
   - Test WebSocket connections for each component
   - Verify real-time updates work correctly
   - Document connection parameters

3. **UI Testing:**
   - Verify layout in different window sizes
   - Check theme compatibility
   - Test keyboard navigation

## Final Deliverables

1. **Updated Code:**
   - UI Manager with simplified architecture
   - Component templates for standardization
   - WebSocket fixes for reliable connections
   - Chat interface integration for all components

2. **Documentation:**
   - Complete implementation notes
   - Component development guide
   - Testing documentation
   - Status reports for the entire sprint

3. **Demo Setup:**
   - Prepare a demo showing before/after for each component
   - Document steps to run the demo
   - Include examples of using the chat interface

Remember: This is a comprehensive UI standardization sprint affecting all Tekton components. The goal is to create a consistent, reliable, and simple UI architecture across the entire system.
