# MCP External Integration Sprint

This directory contains the documentation and planning artifacts for the MCP External Integration Sprint, focusing on integrating external MCP servers into the Tekton ecosystem.

## Overview

The MCP External Integration Sprint builds on the foundation established by the MCP Unified Integration Sprint, enabling integration with external MCP servers such as open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy, and pipedream. This sprint creates standardized patterns for discovering, registering, and securely using external MCP tools within Tekton.

## Key Documents

- [Sprint Plan](./SprintPlan.md): High-level overview of the sprint goals, approach, and timeline

## Related Sprints

This sprint follows and builds upon:
- [MCP Unified Integration Sprint](../MCP_Unified_Integration_Sprint): Established core MCP foundation

The following sprint is superseded by this one:
- [MCPDiscoveryIntegration](../Superceeded/MCPDiscoveryIntegration): Discovery functionality is now incorporated into this sprint

## Sprint Branches

All development for this sprint should be conducted on the branch:

```
sprint/mcp-external-integration-250507
```

Working Claude sessions must verify they are on the correct branch before making any changes using:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/mcp-external-integration-250507
```

## Status and Updates

Status reports and updates will be added to the [StatusReports](./StatusReports) directory as the sprint progresses.

## External Project Integration

This sprint focuses on integrating with the following external projects:

1. **open-mcp**: Integration with the open-mcp registry and standardization approach
2. **pluggedin-mcp-proxy**: Implementation of pluggedin-mcp-proxy as a tool in Ergon
3. **pipedream**: Creation of a dedicated connector for Pipedream's event-driven capabilities

## Next Steps

After completing this sprint, the following initiatives are recommended:

1. **UI Enhancement**: Create a comprehensive UI for managing external MCP tools
2. **Tool Creation Framework**: Develop utilities for creating new MCP-compatible tools
3. **Third-Party Integrations**: Build specific integrations with popular third-party services
