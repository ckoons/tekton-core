# MCP External Integration Sprint

This directory contains the documentation and planning artifacts for the MCP External Integration Sprint, focusing on implementing a universal adapter framework for external MCP services.

## Overview

The MCP External Integration Sprint builds on the foundation established by the MCP Unified Integration Sprint, enabling integration with external MCP services through a flexible, future-proof architecture. This sprint creates a universal adapter framework within Tekton that can work with various external MCP implementations while maintaining control over security, performance, and integration patterns.

## Key Documents

- [Sprint Plan](./SprintPlan.md): High-level overview of the sprint goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](./ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](./ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed implementation tasks and phasing
- [Claude Code Prompt](./ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Claude Code implementation

## Related Sprints

This sprint follows and builds upon:
- [MCP Unified Integration Sprint](../MCP_Unified_Integration_Sprint): Established core MCP foundation

The following sprints are superseded by this one:
- [MCPDiscoveryIntegration](../Superceeded/MCPDiscoveryIntegration): Discovery functionality is now incorporated into this sprint

## Sprint Branches

All development for this sprint should be conducted on the branch:

```
sprint/mcp-external-integration-250507
```

Working Claude sessions must verify they are on the correct branch before making any changes using:

```bash
scripts/github/tekton-branch-verify sprint/mcp-external-integration-250507
```

## Status and Updates

Status reports and updates will be added to the [StatusReports](./StatusReports) directory as the sprint progresses.

## Universal MCP Adapter Approach

Rather than directly implementing specific external MCP projects (such as open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy, or pipedream), this sprint focuses on creating a universal adapter framework that can:

1. Abstract away differences between MCP implementations
2. Provide consistent interfaces for Tekton components
3. Maintain control over security and integration
4. Adapt to evolving standards without major architectural changes
5. Support multiple MCP implementations simultaneously

This approach provides maximum flexibility while ensuring Tekton can integrate with the broader MCP ecosystem.

## External Interoperability Partners

For interoperability testing, the sprint will focus on these external MCP implementations:

1. **Claude Desktop MCP**: Well-documented MCP implementation for testing AI assistant integration
2. **Brave Search MCP Server**: Provides web search capabilities for testing information retrieval
3. **GitHub MCP Servers**: For testing code repository integration
4. **Other reference implementations**: As needed for comprehensive testing

## Next Steps

After completing this sprint, the following initiatives are recommended:

1. **UI Enhancement**: Create a comprehensive UI for managing external MCP tools
2. **Tool Creation Framework**: Develop utilities for creating new MCP-compatible tools
3. **Third-Party Integrations**: Build specific integrations with popular third-party services
