# MCP External Integration - Sprint Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the MCP External Integration Development Sprint. It provides an overview of the goals, approach, and expected outcomes.

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. This development sprint focuses on creating a universal adapter framework for integrating external MCP services, building on the foundation established by the MCP Unified Integration Sprint.

## Sprint Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. **Build Universal MCP Adapter Framework**: Create a flexible abstraction layer in Ergon to interact with external MCP services
2. **Implement Capability Registry**: Extend Hermes to catalog, search, and manage external MCP capabilities
3. **Create Reference Adapters**: Build adapters for key external MCP services (Claude Desktop, Brave Search, GitHub)
4. **Develop Capability Composition**: Enable combining multiple atomic capabilities into higher-level functions
5. **Implement Security Model**: Establish sandboxing and permission controls for external MCP tools
6. **Create Testing Framework**: Build comprehensive testing infrastructure for MCP interoperability

## Business Value

This sprint delivers value by:

- **Extended Capabilities**: Access thousands of external tools and services through MCP without reimplementing them
- **Future-Proofing**: Maintain flexibility as MCP standards evolve without requiring architectural changes
- **Reduced Development Effort**: Reuse existing MCP services rather than building capabilities from scratch
- **Enhanced Security**: Properly sandbox external services with centralized permission management
- **Integration Hub**: Position Tekton as a central hub for MCP-based AI orchestration
- **Compatibility**: Ensure Tekton works with the evolving MCP ecosystem

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Implementation

The MCP Unified Integration Sprint established the core foundation for MCP in Tekton:

1. **Standardized MCP Implementation**: Based on FastMCP's decorator approach
2. **Component Registration**: Unified registration protocol for both component and MCP registration
3. **Request Routing**: MCP request routing between components via Hermes
4. **Integration Patterns**: Basic patterns for external MCP server integration
5. **Architecture Separation**: Hermes for internal communication, Ergon for external integration

### External MCP Services Status

The external MCP ecosystem continues to evolve:

1. **Claude Desktop MCP**: Mature implementation of the MCP standard for AI assistants
2. **Brave Search MCP Server**: Well-documented implementation for web search capabilities
3. **GitHub MCP Servers**: Multiple implementations with varying levels of maturity
4. **Open-MCP**: Emerging standard for converting web APIs to MCP
5. **Pluggedin-MCP-Proxy**: Tool for aggregating multiple MCP servers
6. **Pipedream**: Integration platform with 2,500+ connected apps

### Pain Points

While the foundation is solid, several pain points remain for external integration:

1. **Evolving Standards**: MCP is still evolving, with potential compatibility issues between implementations
2. **Direct Dependencies**: Implementing external MCP projects directly creates tight coupling
3. **Security Concerns**: Insufficient sandboxing and permission management for external tools
4. **Integration Complexity**: Each external server requires custom integration code
5. **Future Compatibility**: Risk of being tied to specific implementations that may change

## Proposed Approach

We will implement a universal adapter framework that provides flexibility while maintaining compatibility with the MCP ecosystem:

1. **Core Abstraction Layer**: Create stable interfaces for Tekton components that abstract away external implementation details
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Implement adapters for different MCP implementations that conform to Tekton's interfaces
3. **Hermes Registry Integration**: Extend Hermes to serve as capability registry and discovery service
4. **Security Sandboxing**: Implement comprehensive security model for external tool access
5. **Capability Composition**: Create mechanisms for combining capabilities across different MCP services

### Key Components Affected

- **tekton-core**: Core interfaces and abstract classes for the adapter framework
- **Hermes**: Enhanced to serve as capability registry and discovery service
- **Ergon**: Primary integration point for external MCP services via universal client
- **Budget**: Integration with external cost management services and token tracking
- **Components using external tools**: Components leveraging external capabilities through the framework

### Technical Approach

The technical approach will focus on a clean, extensible architecture:

1. **Interface-First Design**: Define stable interfaces before implementing adapters
2. **Protocol Adaptation**: Create adapters for different MCP protocol variants
3. **Registry-Based Discovery**: Implement capability registry in Hermes for discovery
4. **Security-First Mindset**: Implement comprehensive security model for external tools
5. **Progressive Implementation**: Start with core framework, then add reference adapters
6. **Token Management Integration**: Ensure Budget component can track token usage across external services

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly out of scope for this sprint:

- **Direct implementation** of open-mcp, pluggedin-mcp-proxy, or pipedream as dependencies
- **UI for Tool Management**: Complete UI redesign for tool management
- **Custom Tool Development**: Creating new MCP servers from scratch
- **Non-MCP Integration**: Integration with non-MCP-compatible systems

## Dependencies

This sprint has the following dependencies:

- **MCP Unified Integration**: Requires completed MCP Unified Integration Sprint
- **External MCP Implementations**: Requires access to Claude Desktop, Brave Search, GitHub MCP for testing
- **Hermes Database Services**: Relies on Hermes' database capabilities for registry
- **Budget Component**: Requires completed Budget implementation from MCP Unified Integration Sprint
