# Initial Status Report: MCP Server Discovery and Integration

## Sprint Planning Status

**Date**: 2025-05-07  
**Phase**: Planning  
**Status**: Planning Complete

## Accomplishments

- Completed comprehensive sprint plan
- Defined key architectural decisions
- Created detailed implementation plan
- Established API and CLI interface specifications
- Setup sprint directory and documentation structure

## Next Steps

- Begin implementation of Phase 1: Core Framework and Discovery Service
- Set up testing framework specific to this implementation
- Create initial schema definitions for MCP server metadata

## Current Focus

The initial focus will be on implementing the registry interfaces and source-specific adapters to enable multi-source discovery of MCP servers. This includes:

1. Creating the base registry interfaces
2. Implementing specific registry sources (NPM, PyPI, GitHub)
3. Defining the metadata schema for MCP servers
4. Setting up the caching system for improved performance

## Potential Roadblocks

- External API limitations for package registries
- Standardization of metadata across different sources
- Security considerations for installing third-party packages

## Questions and Decisions Needed

- Confirmation of security requirements for MCP server installation
- Access to any existing MCP server metadata standards or specifications
- Clarification on integration points with other Tekton components

## Resources Required

- Access to NPM and PyPI API documentation
- GitHub personal access token for API access
- Test environment with sufficient permissions for package installation

## Timeline Update

The implementation timeline remains as defined in the sprint plan:

- **Week 1**: Focus on discovery module and foundation
- **Week 2**: Installation, configuration, and integration

## Overall Status

The sprint planning phase is complete, and we're ready to begin implementation. All necessary documentation and planning artifacts have been created, and the development roadmap is clearly defined.
