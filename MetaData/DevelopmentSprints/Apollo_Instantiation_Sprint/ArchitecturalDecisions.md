# Apollo Instantiation Sprint - Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document records the architectural decisions made for the Apollo Instantiation Sprint. It captures the context, considerations, alternatives considered, and rationale behind each significant decision. This serves as a reference for both current implementation and future development.

Apollo is the executive coordinator and predictive planning system for Tekton's LLM operations, designed to manage context flow, token budgeting, and behavioral reliability across components. This document focuses on the backend architecture that will enable Apollo to fulfill its role.

## Decision 1: Modular Observer-Controller Architecture

### Context

Apollo needs to monitor and influence multiple components without tightly coupling to their internal implementation. It must be able to observe behavior across the system, make predictions, and issue corrective actions when needed.

### Decision

Implement a modular observer-controller architecture where:
1. Apollo consists of loosely coupled modules with clear responsibilities
2. Each module observes specific aspects of system behavior through defined interfaces
3. Controllers issue actions through standardized protocols
4. A central coordinator manages data flow between modules
5. All inter-component communication follows standardized protocols

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Centralized Architecture

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation with all logic in one place
- Easier to reason about state transitions
- Less communication overhead

**Cons:**
- Limited scalability as system grows
- Higher coupling between monitoring and response logic
- Harder to test individual components
- More prone to circular dependencies

#### Alternative 2: Distributed Agents

**Pros:**
- Greater autonomy for different monitoring concerns
- Higher potential scalability
- More resilient to partial failures

**Cons:**
- More complex coordination challenges
- Harder to maintain consistent system view
- Increased message passing overhead
- Less predictable overall behavior

### Decision Rationale

The modular observer-controller architecture strikes a balance between centralization and distribution. It allows for clear separation of concerns while maintaining a coordinated view of the system. This architecture will enable Apollo to evolve incrementally, adding new monitoring capabilities or control actions without disrupting existing functionality.

### Implications

- **Performance**: Moderate impact; requires efficient message passing
- **Maintainability**: Improved through clear module boundaries
- **Extensibility**: New modules can be added without modifying existing ones
- **Testing**: Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Integration**: Well-defined protocols simplify component integration

## Decision 2: Predictive Rule-First Approach

### Context

Apollo needs to predict issues before they occur, but building accurate predictive models for LLM behavior is complex. We need an approach that delivers immediate value while allowing for evolution toward more sophisticated modeling.

### Decision

Implement a rule-first approach to prediction where:
1. Initial implementations use explicit, configurable rules for predictions
2. Rules are defined in a declarative format that can be extended
3. The system is designed to accommodate statistical models in the future
4. Simple metrics like token count, memory usage, and response latency form the initial basis
5. Rules can trigger actions at different threshold levels

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Pure Machine Learning Approach

**Pros:**
- Potentially higher accuracy with sufficient training data
- More capable of finding non-obvious patterns
- Better handling of complex, multi-factor conditions

**Cons:**
- Requires significant training data not yet available
- Harder to reason about decisions
- Longer implementation time before providing value
- More difficult to debug

#### Alternative 2: Pure Heuristic Approach

**Pros:**
- Fastest implementation
- Completely transparent decision-making
- No training required
- Easily adjustable

**Cons:**
- Limited to explicitly identified patterns
- Less adaptable to changing conditions
- May miss complex correlations
- Rigid decision boundaries

### Decision Rationale

The rule-first approach allows for immediate implementation of basic predictive capabilities while setting the stage for more sophisticated models. It creates a framework that can evolve as we gather more operational data and better understand the patterns of LLM behavior across different models and tasks.

### Implications

- **Development**: Faster initial implementation
- **Accuracy**: Initially limited to explicit rule patterns, but sufficient for core use cases
- **Explainability**: High transparency in decision-making
- **Evolution Path**: Clear path to incorporate learning components
- **Configuration**: Rules can be adjusted without code changes

## Decision 3: Protocol-Based Integration

### Context

Apollo needs to integrate with multiple Tekton components, each with its own implementation details. We need an approach that allows Apollo to influence component behavior without tight coupling.

### Decision

Implement protocol-based integration where:
1. Apollo defines clear protocols for component interactions
2. Components like Rhetor implement these protocols, not Apollo-specific interfaces
3. Protocols are version-tracked and follow Tekton naming conventions
4. MCP is used as the primary transport mechanism
5. Components can gradually adopt protocols without breaking changes

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Direct API Integration

**Pros:**
- More direct control over component behavior
- Potentially more efficient without protocol overhead
- Clearer stack traces and error handling

**Cons:**
- Higher coupling between Apollo and components
- More complex dependency management
- Greater potential for breaking changes
- Less flexibility for components

#### Alternative 2: Event-Based Integration

**Pros:**
- Complete decoupling between components
- More flexibility for asynchronous operations
- Better scaling for many components

**Cons:**
- Harder to track request-response flows
- More complex error handling
- Potential for missed or dropped events
- More difficult to debug

### Decision Rationale

Protocol-based integration provides the right balance of structure and flexibility. It allows Apollo to influence component behavior through well-defined interfaces without dictating implementation details. This approach also aligns with Tekton's architectural principles and the existing MCP integration pattern.

### Implications

- **Coupling**: Reduced coupling between Apollo and components
- **Flexibility**: Components can implement protocols in their preferred way
- **Compatibility**: Backward compatibility is easier to maintain
- **Testing**: Protocols can be tested independently of specific implementations
- **Documentation**: Protocol specifications serve as integration documentation

## Decision 4: Tiered Model Support

### Context

Apollo needs to support different types of LLMs with varying capabilities, token contexts, and performance characteristics. We need an architecture that can apply appropriate monitoring and management for each model tier.

### Decision

Implement tiered model support where:
1. Apollo categorizes models into capability tiers (local lightweight, local midweight, remote heavyweight)
2. Each tier has appropriate monitoring thresholds and expectations
3. Token budgets and protocols are tailored to model capabilities
4. Components report model capabilities during initialization
5. Apollo applies tier-appropriate strategies automatically

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Uniform Model Treatment

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation with one set of rules
- Less configuration complexity
- Easier to reason about system behavior

**Cons:**
- Inefficient for lightweight models
- May not leverage capabilities of advanced models
- Potential for false positives/negatives in monitoring
- Limited optimizations for specific model types

#### Alternative 2: Per-Model Configuration

**Pros:**
- Maximum customization for each model
- Optimal performance for each model
- Finest-grained control

**Cons:**
- Explosion of configuration complexity
- Harder to maintain as models evolve
- More difficult to add new models
- Testing complexity increases dramatically

### Decision Rationale

The tiered approach strikes a balance between excessive granularity and overly uniform treatment. It recognizes that models with similar capabilities can be managed with similar strategies, while still accounting for the significant differences between tiers. This approach is also aligned with Tekton's existing tiered model classification.

### Implications

- **Flexibility**: Appropriate handling for different model types
- **Efficiency**: Avoids wasteful monitoring for simple models
- **Scalability**: Easy to accommodate new models within existing tiers
- **Complexity**: Moderate increase in logic complexity
- **Configuration**: Tiered configuration rather than per-model

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Performance Considerations

- Apollo's monitoring must have minimal impact on system performance
- Asynchronous processing should be used where possible
- Sampling rates should be configurable based on system load
- Predictive operations should run on a separate thread from data collection
- Memory usage should be carefully managed for long-running operations

### Security Considerations

- Apollo must not directly access sensitive prompt data
- Component authentication should use Tekton's standard mechanisms
- Configuration changes should be authenticated
- CLI operations that change system behavior should require confirmation
- Debug/monitoring data should be sanitized of sensitive information

### Maintainability Considerations

- Clear separation between modules simplifies maintenance
- Protocol versions should be explicitly tracked
- Configuration should be externalized when appropriate
- Logs should provide clear diagnostic information
- Code should follow Tekton's documentation and testing standards

### Scalability Considerations

- The architecture should support monitoring multiple models concurrently
- Message passing should be efficient even under high volume
- Data storage should be designed for potential growth
- Components should be able to register and unregister dynamically
- Monitoring overhead should scale linearly with system activity

## Future Considerations

- Evolution toward more sophisticated predictive models
- Integration with additional Tekton components
- Extension of protocols for more specialized LLM management
- Dashboard and visualization improvements
- Cross-instance coordination in distributed deployments
