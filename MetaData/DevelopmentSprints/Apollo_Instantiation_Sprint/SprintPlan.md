# Apollo Instantiation Sprint - Sprint Plan

## Overview

The Apollo Instantiation Sprint focuses on creating the backend components for Apollo, Tekton's executive coordinator and predictive planning system that manages LLM operations, context flow, and behavioral reliability. This sprint specifically targets the implementation of the core backend services, CLI tools, and API interfaces, leaving UI components for a future sprint.

Apollo will act as the executive function for Tekton's LLM ecosystem, monitoring token usage, predicting context exhaustion, managing memory allocation, and enforcing operational protocols across the system.

## Objectives

1. **Establish Apollo Core Architecture**: Define and implement the core modules for context monitoring, token budgeting, predictive modeling, and protocol enforcement
2. **Implement API Interfaces**: Create REST API and WebSocket endpoints for interacting with Apollo
3. **Develop CLI Tools**: Build command-line tools for monitoring and controlling LLM operations
4. **Enable Component Integration**: Establish interfaces with Rhetor, Engram, Synthesis, and other Tekton components
5. **Define Protocol Standards**: Create standardized protocols for LLM context management and reliability

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Predictive Operation**: Apollo anticipates issues before they occur, rather than just responding reactively
2. **Non-Invasive Coordination**: Apollo influences components through established interfaces rather than directly modifying their behavior
3. **Reliable Communication**: Apollo uses standardized protocols for all component interactions
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Core functionality is implemented and validated before adding more advanced features
5. **Clean Data Flow**: Data interfaces between components are explicitly defined and documented

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (3 days)**: Core architecture and foundational modules
   - Define module structure
   - Implement basic monitoring capabilities
   - Create data models

2. **Phase 2 (4 days)**: API interfaces and integration
   - Implement REST API endpoints
   - Create WebSocket handlers
   - Develop integration with Rhetor and Engram

3. **Phase 3 (3 days)**: CLI tools and protocol enforcement
   - Implement CLI command framework
   - Create monitoring and control commands
   - Establish protocol enforcement mechanisms

4. **Phase 4 (2 days)**: Testing, documentation, and finalization
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Documentation completion
   - Final adjustments and refinements

## Success Criteria

The sprint will be considered successful if it delivers:

1. A functioning Apollo backend with core context monitoring capabilities
2. Complete API interfaces following the Single Port Architecture pattern
3. CLI tools for basic operations and monitoring
4. Integration with at least Rhetor, Engram, and one other component
5. Comprehensive documentation following Tekton standards
6. Unit and integration tests with adequate coverage

## Components

### Core Functionality
- Token usage monitoring and prediction
- Context state management
- Budget allocation for LLMs
- Protocol definition and enforcement
- Memory prefetch coordination

### API Layer
- REST endpoints for status and control
- WebSocket interface for real-time monitoring
- MCP integration for cross-component communication

### CLI Tools
- Status monitoring commands
- Configuration and control commands
- Predictive forecasting visualization

### Integration Points
- Rhetor for LLM communication
- Engram for memory management
- Synthesis for execution coordination
- Hermes for message routing

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks
1. **Complexity of Predictive Modeling**: Building accurate forecasts of LLM behavior may be challenging
2. **Integration Overhead**: Coordinating with multiple components could introduce unexpected complexities
3. **Performance Concerns**: Monitoring needs to be lightweight to avoid impacting system performance

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Start with simple rule-based predictions before adding more complex modeling
2. Define clear integration contracts upfront with component owners
3. Implement monitoring with configurable sampling rates and enable/disable options

## Sprint Branch

This sprint will use the branch `sprint/Apollo_Instantiation_052025`.

## Working Guidelines

1. **Validate Branch**: Always verify you're working on the correct branch before making changes
2. **Start Simple**: Focus on basic functionality before adding complexity
3. **Commit at Stable Points**: Create commits whenever you reach a stable, working state
4. **Follow Established Patterns**: Follow patterns from other successful Tekton components
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality works correctly before moving on
