# Apollo Instantiation Sprint

## Overview

The Apollo Instantiation Sprint focuses on implementing the backend components for Apollo, Tekton's executive coordinator and predictive planning system. Apollo will serve as the frontal lobe for Tekton's LLM operations, managing context flow, token budgeting, and behavioral reliability across components.

This sprint specifically targets the implementation of core backend services, CLI tools, and API interfaces, with UI components planned for a future sprint.

## Sprint Documents

The following documents define this sprint:

- [Sprint Plan](SprintPlan.md): Outlines the high-level goals, approach, and timeline
- [Architectural Decisions](ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Documents key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](ImplementationPlan.md): Provides detailed implementation tasks and phases
- [Claude Code Prompt](ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Initial prompt for Working Claude

## Sprint Branch

This sprint uses the branch `sprint/Apollo_Instantiation_052025`.

## Key Principles

This sprint is guided by the following key principles:

1. **Predictive Operation**: Apollo anticipates issues before they occur, rather than just responding reactively
2. **Non-Invasive Coordination**: Apollo influences components through established interfaces rather than direct modification
3. **Bidirectional Communication**: Apollo both sends directives to components and responds to their on-demand requests
4. **Component Responsiveness**: Components examine and act on directive messages from Apollo
5. **Universal Accessibility**: Any Tekton component can interface with Apollo as needed
6. **Reliable Communication**: Apollo uses standardized protocols for all component interactions
7. **Progressive Implementation**: Core functionality is implemented and validated before adding more advanced features
8. **Clean Data Flow**: Data interfaces between components are explicitly defined and documented

## Working Guidelines for Development Sessions

For Claude Code sessions and development work during this sprint, follow these guidelines:

1. **Validate Branch First**: Always verify you're working on the correct branch before making changes
   ```bash
   git branch
   # Should show you are on sprint/Apollo_Instantiation_052025
   ```

2. **Start Simple**: Focus on basic functionality before adding complexity
   - First make sure core modules work correctly
   - Then add API interfaces
   - Add more advanced features only after basics work

3. **Commit at Stable Points**: Create commits whenever you reach a stable point
   - Commit after module implementation
   - Commit after API endpoint implementation
   - Commit after each integration point is established

4. **Follow Established Patterns**: 
   - Use Single Port Architecture for APIs
   - Follow Tekton component structure
   - Match error handling and logging patterns from other components

5. **Test Before Moving On**:
   - Verify modules function correctly with unit tests
   - Check integration points with integration tests
   - Confirm API endpoints work as expected

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation alongside code changes
   - Document any challenges or decisions made
   - Create examples for future reference
