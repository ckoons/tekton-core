# Metis UI Component - Development Sprint

## Overview

This Development Sprint focuses on creating a comprehensive UI component for Metis, the task management system in the Tekton ecosystem. The Metis UI component will provide visualization and interaction capabilities for tasks, dependencies, complexity analysis, and PRD parsing results.

## Sprint Documents

This sprint includes the following documents:

- [Sprint Plan](./SprintPlan.md): High-level plan outlining goals, approach, and expected outcomes
- [Architectural Decisions](./ArchitecturalDecisions.md): Key architectural decisions and their rationale
- [Implementation Plan](./ImplementationPlan.md): Detailed implementation tasks, phasing, and requirements
- [Claude Code Prompt](./ClaudeCodePrompt.md): Specific guidance for AI-assisted implementation

## Goals

The primary goals of this sprint are:

1. Create a UI component following the Clean Slate architecture
2. Implement multiple visualization types (list, board, graph)
3. Establish a tab-based interface for different views
4. Integrate with the Metis backend API
5. Ensure component isolation and maintainability

## Implementation Approach

### Athena as the Golden Reference

**CRITICAL: This implementation must strictly follow Athena as the golden template.** All aspects of the Metis component should maintain consistent patterns with Athena, including:

- HTML structure and hierarchy
- CSS BEM naming and selector patterns
- JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation
- State management and component lifecycle

Additional reference implementations to study include:
- **Prometheus**: For advanced visualization techniques
- **Telos**: For requirements management patterns
- **Harmonia**: For state management patterns

### Implementation Phases

This sprint is organized into four phases:

1. **Foundation and Core Structure**: Athena-based component setup, tab system, API client
2. **Task Visualization Types**: Implementation of list, board, and graph views
3. **Specialized Tabs Implementation**: Dependency, Complexity, and PRD tabs
4. **Refinement and Integration**: Polishing, optimization, and complete testing

## Key Features

The Metis UI component will include:

### Tasks Tab
- List, board, and graph views for tasks
- Task creation, editing, and management
- Filtering, sorting, and grouping
- Bulk operations

### Dependency Tab
- Interactive dependency graph visualization
- Critical path highlighting
- Dependency creation and validation
- Filtering and focusing tools

### Complexity Tab
- Complexity score visualization
- Factor breakdown charts
- Comparative analysis
- Resource allocation visualization

### PRD Tab
- Document upload interface
- PRD content preview
- Task generation workflow
- Generated task preview and editing

## Branch Management

This sprint will use the existing Clean Slate branch:

```
sprint/Clean_Slate_051125
```

## Getting Started

To contribute to this sprint:

1. Review the Sprint Plan and Architectural Decisions
2. Understand the Implementation Plan for detailed tasks
3. Follow the Clean Slate architecture pattern
4. Begin with Phase 1 tasks and progress through the phases

## Success Criteria

This sprint will be considered successful if:

- Metis UI component renders correctly in Hephaestus
- All four tabs function properly
- All three visualization types work correctly
- Real-time updates are properly received and displayed
- Component maintains isolation without affecting other components
- UI responsively adapts to different viewport sizes
