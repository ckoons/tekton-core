## Implementation Details

### CLI Interface
The CLI interface has been implemented with comprehensive commands for managing budgets, viewing usage, and interacting with the Budget component. Commands include:

- `status`: Show budget status
- `get_usage`: Get usage data for a period
- `set_limit`: Set budget limits and policies
- `allocate`: Manage budget allocations
- `prices`: Manage model prices
- `recommend`: Get model recommendations
- `calc_cost`: Calculate cost for tokens
- `alerts`: Manage budget alerts

### WebSocket Implementation
WebSocket support has been implemented with real-time updates for various budget events:

- Budget updates: Changes in budget status
- Allocation updates: Creation, usage, and release of allocations
- Alert notifications: Budget limit warnings and violations
- Price updates: Changes in model prices

The WebSocket manager supports multiple topics, client subscriptions, and authentication.

### Budget LLM Assistant
The Budget LLM Assistant provides AI-powered insights and recommendations:

- Budget analysis: Analyze usage patterns and trends
