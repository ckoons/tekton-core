# Apollo Documentation Index

This document serves as a central navigation hub for all Apollo documentation.

## Overview

Apollo is the executive coordinator and predictive planning system for Tekton's LLM operations. It monitors context health, manages token budgets, enforces communication protocols, and recommends corrective actions to ensure optimal system performance.

## Component Relationships

Apollo integrates with several Tekton components:

- **Rhetor**: For monitoring LLM operations and context metrics
- **Hermes**: For message distribution across components
- **Engram**: For persistent context memory and analysis
- **Synthesis**: For action execution coordination
