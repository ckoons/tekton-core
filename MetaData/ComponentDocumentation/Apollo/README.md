# Apollo

## Overview

Apollo is the executive coordinator and predictive planning system for Tekton's LLM operations. It serves as the guardian-advisor component that monitors context health, manages token budgets, enforces communication protocols, and recommends corrective actions to ensure optimal system performance.

## Key Features

- **Context Monitoring**: Tracks and analyzes context usage metrics from Rhetor to identify potential issues
- **Token Budgeting**: Allocates and manages token budgets for different LLM operations across model tiers
- **Predictive Planning**: Anticipates context degradation before it occurs based on historical patterns
- **Protocol Enforcement**: Defines and enforces standards for inter-component communication
- **Action Planning**: Recommends corrective actions based on current states and predictions
- **Health Dashboard**: Provides comprehensive visualization of system health and metrics

## Architecture

Apollo follows the observer-controller architectural pattern with the following core components:

1. **Context Observer**: Monitors context usage metrics and tracks context health
2. **Predictive Engine**: Analyzes historical data to forecast future context states
3. **Action Planner**: Determines appropriate corrective actions based on predictions
4. **Protocol Enforcer**: Validates communication between components against defined standards
5. **Token Budget Manager**: Allocates and tracks token usage across model tiers
6. **Message Handler**: Provides bidirectional messaging functionality for component communication
7. **Apollo Manager**: High-level coordinator that integrates all Apollo components

## Integration Points

Apollo integrates with the following Tekton components:

- **Rhetor**: For monitoring LLM operations and context metrics
- **Hermes**: For message distribution across components
- **Engram**: For persistent context memory and analysis
- **Synthesis**: For action execution coordination

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the Tekton repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tekton.git
cd Tekton

# Install Apollo dependencies
cd Apollo
./setup.sh
```

### Running Apollo

```bash
# Start the Apollo server
./run_apollo.sh

# Verify Apollo is running
curl http://localhost:8001/api/status
```

### Using the CLI

Apollo includes a command-line interface for common operations:

```bash
# Check Apollo status
./apollo/cli/apollo status

# List active contexts
./apollo/cli/apollo contexts

# View system metrics
./apollo/cli/apollo metrics all
```

## API Reference

Apollo implements the Single Port Architecture pattern with path-based routing:

- **HTTP API**: Accessible at `http://localhost:8001/api/`
- **WebSocket API**: Available at `http://localhost:8001/ws`
- **Events API**: For event-based communication at `http://localhost:8001/events`

For detailed API documentation, see the [API Reference](./API_REFERENCE.md).

## Performance Considerations

- Apollo is designed for continuous operation with minimal resource impact
- The prediction engine operates on a configurable interval (default: 60 seconds)
- Action planning occurs on a separate interval (default: 10 seconds)
- Message handling uses batching for efficient communication
- Protocol enforcement has minimal performance impact by default

## Token Budget Tiers

Apollo manages token budgets across three model capability tiers:

1. **LOCAL_LIGHTWEIGHT**: For simple operations (e.g., CodeLlama, Deepseek Coder)
2. **LOCAL_MIDWEIGHT**: For moderate complexity (e.g., Claude Haiku, Qwen)
3. **REMOTE_HEAVYWEIGHT**: For complex reasoning (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4)

## Future Development

Planned enhancements for Apollo include:

- Enhanced predictive algorithms with machine learning capabilities
- More sophisticated action planning with reinforcement learning
- Extended protocol definitions for complex workflows
- Advanced visualization tools for system health monitoring
- Integration with additional LLM providers and models
