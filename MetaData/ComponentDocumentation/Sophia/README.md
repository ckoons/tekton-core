Sophia is the machine learning and continuous improvement component of Tekton, designed to study AI collaboration, measure intelligence dimensions, and enable self-enhancement across components.

## Overview

Sophia serves as the scientific foundation for the Tekton ecosystem, providing metrics collection, analysis, and intelligence measurement capabilities that support continuous learning and improvement. It implements the intelligence dimensions framework for measuring AI cognitive capabilities and provides tools for conducting scientific experiments on AI collaboration.

## Intelligence Dimensions Framework

Sophia implements a comprehensive framework for measuring AI intelligence across 10 dimensions:

1. **Language Processing**: Understanding, interpreting, and generating human language
2. **Reasoning**: Making inferences, deductions, and logical arguments
3. **Knowledge**: Factual information and domain expertise
4. **Learning**: Acquiring new information and adapting from experience
5. **Creativity**: Generating novel, valuable, and surprising outputs
6. **Planning**: Formulating goals and strategies to achieve them
7. **Problem Solving**: Identifying, analyzing, and resolving challenges
8. **Adaptation**: Adjusting behavior based on changing conditions
9. **Collaboration**: Working effectively with other agents or humans
10. **Metacognition**: Awareness and control of one's own thought processes

Each dimension is measured through multiple metrics and can be used to create intelligence profiles for components or the entire ecosystem.

## Experiment Framework

Sophia provides a comprehensive experiment framework supporting multiple experiment types:

- **A/B Testing**: Compare two variants to determine which performs better
- **Multivariate Testing**: Test multiple variables simultaneously
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradually roll out changes to a subset of users
- **Shadow Mode Testing**: Run a new implementation alongside the current one
- **Parameter Tuning**: Find optimal values for configurable parameters
- **Before/After Testing**: Compare metrics before and after a change
- **Baseline Comparisons**: Compare multiple candidates against a baseline

The framework handles experiment design, execution, data collection, and analysis, providing insights and recommendations based on results.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
./setup.sh

# Run the service with the unified launcher
./scripts/tekton-launch --components sophia

# Or run with custom port
SOPHIA_PORT=8006 ./scripts/tekton-launch --components sophia

# Register with Hermes
./register_with_hermes.py
```

## Client Usage

Sophia provides a Python client for easy interaction with the API:

```python
from sophia.client import SophiaClient
import asyncio

async def example():
    # Create client
    client = SophiaClient(base_url="http://localhost:8006")
    
    try:
        # Check availability
        if await client.is_available():
            # Submit a metric
            await client.submit_metric(
                metric_id="component.performance.latency",
                value=42.5,
                source="my_component",
                tags=["performance", "latency"]
            )
            
            # Query metrics
            metrics = await client.query_metrics(
                metric_id="component.performance.latency",
                source="my_component",
                limit=10
            )
            
            # Create an experiment
            experiment_id = await client.create_experiment(
                name="Latency Optimization",
                description="Testing a new algorithm to reduce latency",
                experiment_type="a_b_test",
                target_components=["my_component"],
                hypothesis="The new algorithm reduces latency by 20%",
                metrics=["component.performance.latency"],
                parameters={
                    "control": {"algorithm": "current"},
                    "treatment": {"algorithm": "new"}
                }
            )
            
            # Get intelligence profile
            profile = await client.get_component_intelligence_profile("my_component")
            
            # Compare components
            comparison = await client.compare_intelligence_profiles(
                component_ids=["component_a", "component_b"],
                dimensions=["language_processing", "reasoning"]
            )
    finally:
        # Close client
