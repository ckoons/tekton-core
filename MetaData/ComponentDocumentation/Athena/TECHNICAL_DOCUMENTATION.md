# Athena Technical Documentation

## System Architecture

Athena's architecture is designed around a core entity management system that powers a knowledge graph. The system consists of several layers:

### Core Layer

The foundation of Athena consists of these key modules:

- **Entity**: Represents a discrete piece of information with properties and metadata
- **EntityManager**: Handles CRUD operations for entities and maintains entity lifecycle
- **Relationship**: Defines connections between entities with type and directional properties
- **Graph Adapters**: Provide storage implementations for the knowledge graph
  - `memory_adapter.py`: In-memory graph storage for testing and lightweight usage
  - `neo4j_adapter.py`: Neo4j database adapter for production deployments
- **QueryEngine**: Processes and executes queries against the knowledge graph

### API Layer

Exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with Athena:

- **EntityEndpoints**: Manage entity lifecycle and properties
- **KnowledgeGraphEndpoints**: Manipulate and query the graph structure
- **QueryEndpoints**: Execute and manage queries
- **VisualizationEndpoints**: Generate visual representations of the graph
- **LLMIntegrationEndpoints**: Leverage LLM capabilities for knowledge extraction

### Integrations Layer

- **Hermes Integration**: Communication with other Tekton components
- **Memory Adapters**: Connection to Engram for persistent memory

## Knowledge Graph Implementation

Athena implements a property graph model with the following characteristics:

- **Entities as Nodes**: Each entity becomes a node in the graph with properties
- **Typed Relationships**: Connections between entities have specific semantic meanings
- **Property Storage**: Both entities and relationships can have associated properties
- **Subgraph Queries**: Support for querying specific subgraphs based on entity types and relationship patterns

### Graph Query Language

Athena supports multiple query approaches:

1. **Direct API Queries**: Structured JSON-based query format
2. **Natural Language Queries**: Processed and converted to structured queries
3. **Pattern Matching**: Entity and relationship pattern-based queries
4. **Property Filtering**: Query by entity and relationship properties

## Entity Model

Entities in Athena have the following structure:

```python
class Entity:
    id: str  # Unique identifier
    type: str  # Entity type
    name: str  # Human-readable name
    properties: Dict[str, Any]  # Custom properties
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Internal metadata
    relationships: List[Relationship]  # Connected relationships
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

## Relationship Model

```python
class Relationship:
    id: str  # Unique identifier
    type: str  # Relationship type
    source_id: str  # Source entity ID
    target_id: str  # Target entity ID
    properties: Dict[str, Any]  # Custom properties
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]  # Internal metadata
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
```

## Query Engine

The query engine supports several query types:

1. **Entity Retrieval**: Get entities by ID, type, or property values
2. **Path Finding**: Discover paths between entities
3. **Pattern Matching**: Find subgraphs matching specific patterns
4. **Aggregate Queries**: Compute aggregate statistics over the graph
5. **LLM-Enhanced Queries**: Leverage LLMs for semantic understanding

## Visualization System

Athena provides graph visualization capabilities through:

- **JSON Graph Format**: Standardized format for graph data exchange
- **D3.js Integration**: Web-based interactive graph visualization
- **Subgraph Selection**: Visualization of specific entity clusters
- **Dynamic Layouts**: Force-directed and hierarchical layout algorithms

## LLM Integration

Large language models are integrated to enhance Athena's capabilities:

- **Entity Extraction**: Identifying potential entities from unstructured text
- **Relationship Discovery**: Suggesting connections between entities
- **Query Translation**: Converting natural language to structured queries
- **Knowledge Enrichment**: Augmenting entities with additional information

## Performance Considerations

- **Graph Indexing**: Optimized indexes for entity properties and relationship types
- **Query Caching**: Frequently used query results are cached
- **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk entity and relationship operations
- **Lazy Loading**: Relationships are loaded on-demand for large graphs

## Security Model

- **Entity-Level Permissions**: Control access to specific entities
- **Query Restrictions**: Limit query complexity and scope
- **Audit Logging**: Track changes to the knowledge graph
- **Data Validation**: Enforce schema and property constraints
