# Athena

## Overview

Athena is a knowledge graph system designed to store, organize, and retrieve information about entities and their relationships. It serves as the semantic understanding layer within the Tekton ecosystem, providing a structured approach to representing knowledge and enabling sophisticated query capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Entity Management**: Create, update, and manage entities with properties, metadata, and relationships
- **Knowledge Graph**: Build and query a semantic network of interconnected information
- **Query Engine**: Execute complex queries against the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant information
- **Visualization**: Generate visual representations of the knowledge graph and query results
- **LLM Integration**: Leverage large language models to enhance entity understanding and knowledge extraction
- **Hermes Integration**: Seamless communication with other Tekton components through the Hermes messaging system

## Architecture

Athena follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Core Engine**: Manages entities, relationships, and graph operations
2. **Graph Storage**: Provides persistence for the knowledge graph (supports in-memory and Neo4j adapters)
3. **Query Engine**: Processes and executes queries against the knowledge graph
4. **API Layer**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for interacting with Athena
5. **UI Components**: Visualization and interaction interfaces for knowledge exploration

## Integration Points

Athena integrates with:

- **Hermes**: For centralized message routing and service discovery
- **Engram**: For memory persistence and context management
- **Rhetor**: For natural language processing and query translation
- **Telos**: For requirements tracing and project context

## Getting Started

See the [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for setup instructions and the [Integration Guide](./INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md) for details on connecting Athena with other Tekton components.

## API Reference
