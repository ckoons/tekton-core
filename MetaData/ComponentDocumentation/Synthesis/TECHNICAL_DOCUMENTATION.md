# Synthesis Technical Documentation

This document provides detailed technical information about the Synthesis component's architecture, internal systems, and implementation details.

## Architecture Overview

Synthesis is built around a modular architecture designed for flexibility, extensibility, and robustness. The component follows the Single Port Architecture pattern and is structured into several key layers:

1. **API Layer**: Provides HTTP and WebSocket interfaces for interacting with the system
2. **Core Engine**: Implements the execution, integration, and event processing logic
3. **Integrations Layer**: Handles communication with external systems and other Tekton components
4. **Storage Layer**: Manages persistence of execution data, plans, and events
5. **UI Layer**: Provides visualization and control interfaces for the Hephaestus UI

## Core Execution Engine

The execution engine is the heart of Synthesis, responsible for the step-by-step execution of processes.

### Execution Models

The engine uses a hierarchical model structure:

- **Plan**: The top-level structure defining a complete process
- **Step**: Individual units of work within a plan
- **StepType**: Different types of steps (command, function, API, etc.)
- **Execution**: A running instance of a plan
- **ExecutionContext**: The shared state and variables for an execution
- **ExecutionResult**: The outcome of an execution

### Dependency Resolution

Steps can specify dependencies, creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of execution. The engine:

1. Builds a dependency graph
2. Identifies independent steps that can run in parallel
3. Schedules steps based on dependency resolution
4. Manages execution flow when dependencies fail

### Variable Substitution

Variables can be defined and used throughout an execution:

- **Static Variables**: Defined in the plan
- **Dynamic Variables**: Generated during execution
- **Step Outputs**: Results from previous steps
- **Environment Variables**: From the execution environment

Variable substitution occurs before step execution, supporting:

- **String Interpolation**: `"Hello, ${name}!"`
- **Expression Evaluation**: `"${count > 5 ? 'many' : 'few'}"`
- **JSON Path**: `"${response.data.items[0].id}"`

### Step Handlers

Step handlers are responsible for executing different types of steps:

- **CommandStepHandler**: Executes shell commands
- **FunctionStepHandler**: Calls registered Python functions
- **ApiStepHandler**: Makes HTTP requests

### Loop Handlers

Loop handlers manage different types of loop execution:

- **ForLoopHandler**: Iterates a fixed number of times
- **WhileLoopHandler**: Continues until a condition is false
- **ForEachLoopHandler**: Iterates over a collection
- **CountLoopHandler**: Increments a counter variable
- **ParallelLoopHandler**: Executes iterations in parallel

### Error Handling

The execution engine implements robust error handling:

- **Retry Policies**: Configurable retry with backoff
- **Error Recovery**: Strategies for continuing after errors
- **Partial Completion**: Ability to mark steps as successful even after partial failures
- **Checkpointing**: Regular state persistence for recovery
