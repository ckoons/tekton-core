# Hephaestus UI Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** June 20, 2025

## Current Status

Phase 10.5 (Ergon State Management) completed. Building upon our experience with the State Management Pattern in GitHub integration, we've developed a specialized, reactive state management system for the Ergon component. This implementation provides optimized handling for agent states, execution tracking, and agent-specific operations, while significantly reducing boilerplate code through higher-order state management functions. The new system includes a dedicated ErgonStateManager, component utilities for Ergon state, a service abstraction layer, and comprehensive testing utilities. The implementation features reactive UI patterns with automatic DOM rebinding, form validation and management, and a transaction-based approach to state updates that improves performance for complex state operations. This specialized state system serves as a foundation for the Ergon agent management interface and will be the template for future component-specific state management solutions.
