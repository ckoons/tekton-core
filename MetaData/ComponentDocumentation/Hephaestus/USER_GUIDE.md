## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Connection Issues

**Problem**: Components show as unavailable or disconnected.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the component services are running:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/tekton-status
   ```
2. Make sure the required components are launched:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/tekton-launch --components <component-name>
   ```
3. Check for network issues by opening the browser console (F12) and looking for connection errors.
4. Try refreshing the page.

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: UI becomes slow or unresponsive.

**Solutions**:
1. Close unused component tabs.
2. Clear browser cache and reload.
3. Check system resources (CPU, memory) with Task Manager or Activity Monitor.
4. Disable resource-intensive visualizations if not needed.
5. Try a different browser.

### Display Issues

**Problem**: UI elements appear misaligned or incorrectly styled.

**Solutions**:
1. Try switching between themes.
2. Reset browser zoom (Ctrl+0).
3. Clear browser cache and reload.
4. Try a different browser.
5. Check browser console for CSS errors.

### Component-Specific Issues

**Problem**: A specific component doesn't work as expected.

**Solutions**:
1. Check if the component service is running:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/tekton-status | grep <component-name>
   ```
2. Restart the component:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/tekton-kill --components <component-name>
   ./scripts/tekton-launch --components <component-name>
   ```
3. Check the component logs for errors:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/<component-name>.log
   ```

### Browser Console

For more detailed troubleshooting, open the browser console:
1. Press F12 or right-click and select "Inspect"
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Look for error messages or warnings

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices for effective use of Hephaestus:

### Workflow Organization

1. **Use Component Tabs**: Keep related work in separate component tabs.
2. **Leverage Split View**: Use split views to see multiple components side by side.
3. **Save Common Configurations**: Save frequently used configurations and queries.
4. **Use Consistent Naming**: Adopt consistent naming conventions for tasks, entities, and workflows.

### Terminal Usage

1. **Use AI Commands**: Leverage `/ai` commands for complex operations.
2. **Create Aliases**: Define aliases for frequently used commands.
3. **Save Command History**: Export important command sequences for future reference.
4. **Use Tab Completion**: Save time with tab completion for commands and paths.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Close Unused Tabs**: Close component tabs you're not actively using.
2. **Limit Visualization Scope**: When working with large graphs or datasets, limit the visualization scope.
3. **Clear Cache Regularly**: Clear browser cache periodically for optimal performance.
4. **Use Appropriate View Modes**: Switch between simple and detailed views based on your needs.

### Data Management

1. **Regular Backups**: Export important configurations and data regularly.
2. **Clean Up Old Data**: Archive or delete unnecessary data to maintain performance.
3. **Organize by Projects**: Use tags or categories to organize data by project.
4. **Version Important Artifacts**: Maintain versions of important workflows, queries, or configurations.
