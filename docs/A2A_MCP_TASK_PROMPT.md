# A2A and MCP Implementation Task Prompt

I'd like you to implement the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Framework and Multimodal Cognitive Protocol (MCP) for the Tekton ecosystem. These technologies will enable autonomous agent collaboration and enhanced multimodal information processing throughout the system.

## Background

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. We've already implemented several core components:

1. **Hermes**: The message bus for component communication
2. **Ergon**: Our agent framework for creating specialized AI agents
3. **Engram**: Memory system for persistent storage
4. **Rhetor**: LLM interaction and context management system
5. **Athena**: Knowledge graph for storing and reasoning about relationships
6. **Synthesis**: Execution and integration engine for workflows
7. **Sophia**: Machine learning and continuous improvement component

The next evolutionary step is to implement A2A and MCP, which will enable these components to communicate more effectively, collaborate autonomously, and process multimodal information seamlessly.

## Task Overview

Your task is to implement the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication Framework and Multimodal Cognitive Protocol (MCP) based on the designs in `A2A_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` and related documentation. This implementation should enable:

1. **Autonomous Agent Collaboration**: Agents should be able to discover each other, communicate, delegate tasks, and work together
2. **Multimodal Information Processing**: Components should be able to handle text, code, images, and structured data consistently
3. **Enhanced Context Awareness**: Rich contextual information should be maintained across interactions
4. **Standardized Tool Access**: Agents should be able to access tools through a common interface

## Specific Deliverables

Please implement the following key components:

### 1. A2A Protocol Layer

- **Agent Registry**: System for registering and discovering agents
- **Message Router**: Component for routing messages between agents
- **Task Manager**: System for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks
- **Conversation Manager**: Component for managing multi-message conversations

### 2. MCP Protocol Layer

- **Message Processor**: System for parsing and processing MCP messages
- **Modality Handlers**: Specialized processors for text, code, images, and structured data
- **Context Manager**: Component for managing rich contextual information
- **Content Integrator**: System for integrating multiple modalities

### 3. Integration Components

- **Hermes A2A Adapter**: Integration with the Hermes message bus
- **Ergon MCP Client**: Integration with the Ergon agent framework
- **Tool Registry**: Management system for MCP-compatible tools
- **External Gateway**: Interface for external A2A agents

## Implementation Details

The implementation should follow these guidelines:

1. **Use Existing Patterns**: Follow the established patterns in Tekton, particularly:
   - Single Port Architecture for HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
   - Standard error handling using the tekton_errors utility
   - Shared component utilities from tekton-core

2. **JSON Schema Validation**: Implement proper validation for all message formats:
   - A2A messages should follow the schema in the implementation guide
   - MCP messages should validate against the MCP schema
   - Agent cards should conform to the agent card schema

3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Use async/await throughout for non-blocking operations

4. **Type Annotations**: Include comprehensive type hints for all functions

5. **Documentation**: Add detailed docstrings for all public APIs

6. **Tests**: Create unit and integration tests for all major components

## Resources

To help with your implementation, you have access to these resources:

1. **A2A_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide for implementation
2. **SINGLE_PORT_ARCHITECTURE.md**: Guide for HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
3. **SHARED_COMPONENT_UTILITIES.md**: Documentation on tekton-core utilities
4. **Other documents in MetaData/Brainstorm/**: Additional design insights

## Implementation Approach

I recommend this phased approach:

1. **Phase 1 (Core Protocol Infrastructure)**:
   - Implement A2A message formats and validation
   - Create MCP message processing
   - Build Hermes integration for both protocols

2. **Phase 2 (Agent Capabilities)**:
   - Implement agent registry and discovery
   - Create task management system
   - Build agent communication patterns

3. **Phase 3 (Multimodal Processing)**:
   - Implement modality-specific processors
   - Create context management system
   - Build content integration engine

4. **Phase 4 (Component Integration)**:
   - Enhance Ergon with A2A and MCP
   - Update relevant components
   - Build external gateway

## Key Files to Implement

The implementation should include these key files:

1. **A2A Core**:
   - `a2a/message.py`: A2A message format and validation
   - `a2a/agent_registry.py`: Agent registration and discovery
   - `a2a/task_manager.py`: Task creation and management
   - `a2a/conversation.py`: Conversation management

2. **MCP Core**:
   - `mcp/message.py`: MCP message format and validation
   - `mcp/context.py`: Context creation and management
   - `mcp/processor.py`: Message processing pipeline
   - `mcp/modality/`: Modality-specific processors

3. **Integration**:
   - `hermes/a2a_service.py`: A2A service in Hermes
   - `ergon/mcp_client.py`: MCP client for Ergon
   - `mcp/tool_registry.py`: Tool registration and discovery
   - `a2a/external_gateway.py`: Gateway for external agents

4. **API Layer**:
   - `a2a/api/app.py`: A2A API endpoints
   - `mcp/api/app.py`: MCP API endpoints
   - `a2a/api/websocket.py`: WebSocket for A2A
   - `mcp/api/websocket.py`: WebSocket for MCP

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be successful when:

1. **A2A Communication**:
   - Agents can register and discover each other
   - Agents can send and receive messages
   - Tasks can be delegated and completed
   - Conversations can span multiple messages

2. **MCP Processing**:
   - Components can handle multimodal messages
   - Different modalities are processed appropriately
   - Context is maintained across interactions
   - Responses include appropriate modalities

3. **Integration**:
   - Hermes effectively routes A2A messages
   - Ergon agents can use MCP for communication
   - Tools can be registered and discovered
   - External agents can connect securely

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests pass for all components
   - Integration tests demonstrate end-to-end functionality
   - Performance tests show acceptable latency

## Additional Notes

1. **Security**: Implement appropriate authentication and authorization

2. **Performance**: Ensure efficient processing, especially for large messages

3. **Backward Compatibility**: Allow existing components to work with the new protocols

4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for future maintenance
