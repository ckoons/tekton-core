# Sophia Intelligence Dimensions Framework

This document describes the Intelligence Dimensions Framework implemented by Sophia, the machine learning and continuous improvement component of the Tekton ecosystem.

## Overview

The Intelligence Dimensions Framework provides a structured approach to measuring AI cognitive capabilities across multiple dimensions. It enables the quantification, comparison, and tracking of AI system intelligence, supporting continuous improvement and targeted enhancements.

2. **Targeted Improvement**: Identifying specific dimensions that require enhancement
3. **Component Specialization**: Allowing components to specialize in particular dimensions
4. **Collaborative Synergy**: Creating systems where components with complementary intelligence profiles work together
