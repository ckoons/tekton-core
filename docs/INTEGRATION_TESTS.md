# Tekton Integration Tests

This document describes the integration tests and documentation for Tekton component integration.

## Test Suite Overview

The Tekton component integration is tested through multiple test suites:

1. **Component Lifecycle Tests**: Basic lifecycle operations and state transitions
2. **End-to-End Integration Tests**: Component interaction with fallbacks
3. **Stress Tests**: System behavior under load and failure conditions
4. **Deployment Tests**: Component deployment and startup sequence

## Running the Tests

### Component Lifecycle Tests

Tests basic lifecycle operations, including registration, state transitions, and heartbeat monitoring:

```bash
python scripts/test_component_lifecycle.py
```

This test demonstrates:
- Component registration and state transitions
- Heartbeat monitoring and automatic state degradation
- Basic metrics collection and reporting

### End-to-End Integration Tests

Tests complete component interactions, including fallbacks and graceful degradation:

```bash
python scripts/test_component_integration.py
```

This test demonstrates:
- Multi-component system with primary and backup services
- Dependency management between components
- Fallback to backup services when primary fails
- Client interaction with fallback-enabled services

### Stress Tests

Tests system behavior under load and with simulated failures:

```bash
python scripts/test_stress.py
```

This test demonstrates:
- Multiple concurrent clients and services
- Random service failures and recovery
- Performance under load
- Graceful degradation with fallbacks
- Circuit breaker behavior

### Deployment Tests

Tests component deployment and startup sequence:

```bash
python scripts/deploy_components.py --config config/components.json
```

This test demonstrates:
- Dependency-based deployment ordering
- Component health checking during startup
- Centralized logging of component output
- Graceful shutdown in reverse dependency order

## Test Scenarios

### Basic Component Lifecycle

1. Component registers with the system
2. Component transitions to READY state
3. Component sends regular heartbeats
4. Component updates its metrics
5. Component transitions to different states
6. Component unregisters and shuts down

### Component Failure and Recovery

1. Component enters DEGRADED state (high CPU, memory, error rate)
2. System detects degraded component via metrics
3. Alerts are generated for degraded component
4. Component attempts recovery
5. Component either returns to READY state or fails

### Graceful Degradation

1. Primary service fails or becomes degraded
2. Client requests are automatically routed to backup service
3. Backup service processes requests with reduced functionality
4. Primary service recovers
5. Client requests return to primary service

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

1. Component calls dependent service
2. Dependent service starts failing
3. Circuit breaker opens after threshold failures
4. Fallback is used for subsequent calls
5. Circuit enters half-open state after timeout
6. Circuit fully closes when dependent service recovers

### System Under Load

1. Multiple clients generate concurrent requests
2. Services handle requests with varying latency
3. Some services randomly fail
4. System maintains overall functionality
5. Performance metrics are collected and reported

## Documentation

The component integration system is documented in the following files:

- [Component Integration Guide](COMPONENT_INTEGRATION.md): Comprehensive guide to the component integration system
- [Component Lifecycle README](../tekton-core/tekton/core/COMPONENT_LIFECYCLE_README.md): Detailed documentation of the component lifecycle management
- [Code Documentation](../tekton-core/tekton/core): In-code documentation for all modules

### Example Code

Example code demonstrating the component integration system:

- [Component Health Adapter](../tekton-core/tekton/core/integration/component_health_integration.py): Simplified interface for component health management
- [Test Component Integration](../scripts/test_component_integration.py): Example of a multi-component system
- [Test Stress](../scripts/test_stress.py): Example of system under load

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic component lifecycle tests
2. **Build Complexity**: Add components incrementally
3. **Include Failure Scenarios**: Always test failure and recovery
4. **Test Under Load**: Verify behavior with concurrent requests
5. **Automate Deployment**: Use deployment scripts for consistent testing
6. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Track CPU, memory during tests
7. **Analyze Metrics**: Review performance metrics after tests
8. **Validate Fallbacks**: Ensure fallbacks provide required functionality

## Continuous Integration

For continuous integration, include these tests in your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example CI configuration
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - python scripts/test_component_lifecycle.py
    - python scripts/test_component_integration.py
    - python scripts/test_stress.py --short
```

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Long-Running Stability Tests**: Run system for days to detect memory leaks
2. **Chaos Testing**: Randomly kill components to test recovery
3. **Network Partition Tests**: Test behavior with network failures
4. **Resource Limit Tests**: Test with constrained CPU and memory
5. **Large Scale Tests**: Test with hundreds of components
