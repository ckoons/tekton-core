# Sophia Implementation Task Prompt

I'd like you to implement Sophia, the machine learning and continuous improvement component for the Tekton ecosystem. Sophia serves two primary purposes:

1. Scientifically study AI cognitive abilities through measurements, metrics, and analysis
2. Enable continuous self-improvement by identifying optimization opportunities across all Tekton components

## Background

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system for AI collaboration and software engineering automation. Sophia will be a critical component that measures AI performance, analyzes patterns, conducts experiments, and generates recommendations for improvements.

The foundation for Sophia already exists with minimal structure and a basic ML engine implementation, but we need to build out the comprehensive functionality described in the project documentation.

## Your Task

Implement the full Sophia component following the specifications in the provided documentation:

1. **Core Engines**:
   - Enhance the existing `ml_engine.py` with full model management capabilities
   - Create new engines for metrics collection, analysis, experimentation, and recommendations
   - Implement the intelligence measurement framework

2. **API Layer**:
   - Implement HTTP API using FastAPI following the Single Port Architecture
   - Create WebSocket interface for real-time updates
   - Develop endpoints for metrics, experiments, recommendations, and intelligence reports

3. **Integration**:
   - Implement Hermes registration for component discovery
   - Create adapters for Engram (storage) and Prometheus (planning)
   - Build standard interfaces for other components to submit metrics

4. **UI Component**:
   - Develop a Hephaestus UI component with dashboard, visualizations, and management interfaces
   - Implement real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Create an intuitive interface for viewing metrics, experiments, and recommendations

5. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Update the README with comprehensive information
   - Create implementation status tracking
   - Implement thorough testing for all functionality

## Implementation Guidelines

Follow these guidelines during implementation:

1. Use the shared utilities from `tekton-core` for consistent patterns
2. Implement the Single Port Architecture as described in the documentation
3. Use async/await throughout for non-blocking operations
4. Add comprehensive error handling and logging
5. Include type annotations and docstrings for all public APIs
6. Create abstractions that minimize coupling between modules
7. Develop tests for all key functionality

## Resources

Refer to these documents for detailed specifications:

1. `SOPHIA_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive implementation guidance
2. `SOPHIA_DELIVERABLES.md`: Complete list of required files and components
3. `SOPHIA_ARCHITECTURE.md`: Architecture and system design
4. `SOPHIA_SESSION_PREPARATION.md`: Additional context and implementation details

Also, examine the existing files:
- `README.md`: Current basic overview
- `examples/client_usage.py`: Example client implementation
- `sophia/core/ml_engine.py`: Existing ML engine implementation

## Approach

I recommend this implementation approach:

1. Start with enhancing the core ML engine and implementing the metrics engine
2. Build out the data models and storage mechanisms
3. Implement the API layer with HTTP and WebSocket endpoints
4. Create the analysis engine and recommendation system
5. Develop the experiment framework and intelligence measurement
6. Implement the UI component
7. Add comprehensive testing and documentation

## Priorities

Focus on these priorities during implementation:

1. Core functionality for metrics collection and analysis
2. Robust API layer with proper error handling
3. Effective integration with other Tekton components
4. Clear and intuitive UI for visualization and management
5. Comprehensive documentation for future extension

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be successful when:

1. Sophia can collect metrics from all Tekton components
2. The analysis engine can identify patterns and generate insights
3. The recommendation system can suggest meaningful improvements
4. The experiment framework can validate improvement hypotheses
5. The intelligence measurement system can quantify AI capabilities
6. All APIs are well-documented and tested
7. The UI provides effective visualization and management

Please proceed with implementing Sophia according to these specifications. You may ask clarifying questions or request additional information at any point during the implementation process.
