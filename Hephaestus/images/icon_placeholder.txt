Placeholder for Hephaestus icon.

An icon representing Hephaestus (the Greek god of craftsmen, technology, and forge) would be appropriate here.

Suggested imagery:
- Hammer and anvil (traditional symbols of Hephaestus)
- Modern interpretation with UI elements and tools
- Consistent with other Tekton component icons
