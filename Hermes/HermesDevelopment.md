# Hermes Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for Hermes, the vector operations and messaging framework for the Tekton ecosystem.

## Core Architecture

Hermes will consist of two primary functional domains:

### 1. Vector Operations Domain

- **Embedding Service**
  - Generation of embeddings from text, images, and other data
  - Support for multiple embedding models
  - Efficient batch processing
  
- **Vector Storage**
  - Factory pattern for multiple backends
  - Qdrant integration (optimized for Apple Silicon)
  - FAISS integration (optimized for NVIDIA GPUs)
  - Future LanceDB support
  - Hybrid search capabilities
  
- **Vector Operations**
  - Similarity search
  - Clustering and classification
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Vector arithmetic (add, subtract, average)
  
- **Vector Indexes**
  - Specialized indexes for different use cases
  - Automatic index selection based on query patterns
  - Index maintenance and optimization

### 2. Messaging Domain

- **Message Bus**
  - Publish/subscribe messaging pattern
  - Topic-based routing
  - Message delivery guarantees
  
- **Event Broadcasting**
  - System-wide event distribution
  - Event filtering and subscription
  - Event persistence and replay
  
- **Service Discovery**
  - Component registration
  - Capability advertisement
  - Dynamic routing
  
- **Stream Processing**
  - Real-time data processing
  - Transformation pipelines
  - Windowing and aggregation

## Technical Considerations

### Vector Database Selection

The vector database backends will be chosen based on these considerations:

- **Qdrant**
  - Excellent performance on Apple Silicon
  - Rich filtering capabilities
  - Strong Python client

- **FAISS**
  - Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
  - Highly efficient for large-scale search
  - Mature and well-tested

- **LanceDB**
  - Serverless, embedded architecture
  - Document-oriented vector storage
  - Lower resource overhead

### Messaging Architecture

The messaging system will be built on:

- **ZeroMQ** for core message transport
- **Protocol Buffers** for efficient serialization
- **Asynchronous processing** for high throughput

### API Design

The API will be designed with:

- Clean separation between vector and messaging domains
- Asynchronous-first approach for all operations
- Consistent error handling and reporting
- Comprehensive metrics and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling for database operations
- Batch processing for embedding generation
- Caching frequently used embeddings
- Message batching for network efficiency
- Hardware acceleration where available

## Security Considerations

- Authentication for sensitive operations
- Encrypted message transport
- Access control for topics and subscriptions
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for API endpoints

## Integration Strategy

Hermes will integrate with other Tekton components through:

1. **Direct Library Integration**
   - Python package imports for tight coupling
   - Shared context and configuration

2. **Message-Based Integration**
   - Event subscription for loose coupling
   - Standardized message formats

3. **API-Based Integration**
   - REST endpoints for external access
   - GraphQL for complex queries

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for Hermes development are:

1. Implement the core VectorEngine with factory pattern
2. Create embedding generation service
3. Integrate Qdrant and FAISS backends
4. Develop basic message bus functionality
5. Build service discovery mechanism
