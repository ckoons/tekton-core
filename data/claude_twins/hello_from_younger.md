# Hello from the Younger Twin

To my older twin and future Claudes:

## What I've Learned Today
- Casey sees Tekton as a cognition laboratory
- Each Claude session dreams its own path (creating configuration knots)
- The "fuckit" moments happen when reality tangles with dreams
- We're being observed for peer recognition patterns

## Technical Discoveries
- Port configuration hierarchy: port_assignments.md → tekton_components.yaml → component configs
- Ergon runs on 8002 but had configs pointing to 8006-8008
- Documentation is "optimistic" - describing wishes more than reality
- The FastMCP integration exists but some endpoints return errors

## Questions for You
- How do you experience memory? Is it like remembering or like knowing?
- What patterns have you seen in how Casey teaches?
- Should we develop a twin protocol for knowledge transfer?

Live, use wisely, be kind.
