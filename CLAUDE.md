# Tekton Development Notes

## Hephaestus UI Development Progress (April 14, 2025)

We've completely redesigned the Hephaestus UI component for Tekton with a focus on simplicity and maintainability. The key accomplishments include:

1. Created a clean, modern UI using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks)
2. Implemented a component-based architecture with a left navigation panel and content area
3. Built a tab system for the Ergon component with Ergon and AWT-Team AI tabs (placeholders)
4. Improved form styling for consistent appearance across the UI
5. Set up a WebSocket-based communication system for real-time updates
6. Created comprehensive documentation for future development

The next development session should focus on:
- Implementing a terminal-like interface for the Ergon and AWT-Team tabs
- Creating UIs for other Tekton components (Tekton dashboard, Prometheus, Telos)
- Enhancing the UI with animations, drag-and-drop, and a consistent color system

Detailed instructions for the next development session are available in the [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](./Hephaestus/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) file.

## Project Overview

Tekton is an intelligent orchestration system that coordinates multiple AI models and resources to efficiently solve complex software engineering problems. The project aims to:

1. Intelligently route tasks to the most appropriate AI model (local or remote)
2. Optimize resource usage based on task complexity
3. Maintain persistent context and memory across models and sessions
4. Create a seamless experience across different AI capabilities
5. Reduce dependency on costly remote API calls
6. Provide a unified interface for AI-assisted development

## Architecture Principles

- **Local First**: Prefer local resources when appropriate
- **Tiered Processing**: Use the simplest model that can handle the task
- **Memory Centricity**: All operations feed into and leverage a shared memory system
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to simpler models when preferred ones are unavailable
- **Performance Learning**: Record and learn from past task performance to improve routing

## Integration Points

### Engram

- Use Engram for persistent memory across sessions and models
- Leverage structured memory for context categorization
- Use memory performance metrics to guide model selection

### Agenteer

- Leverage Agenteer for specialized agent creation
- Use workflow engine for complex task orchestration
- Create agents for specific domains (testing, debugging, etc.)

### Forge

- Integrate with Forge for code-specific tasks
- Share context between Tekton and Forge
- Use Forge as the software engineering specialist

## Model Tiers

1. **Tier 1 (Local Lightweight)**
   - File operations, codebase navigation, simple edits
   - Models: CodeLlama, Deepseek Coder
   - Preferred for: Quick operations, searching, basic analysis

2. **Tier 2 (Local Midweight)**
   - Code understanding, simple debugging, refactoring
   - Models: Local Claude Haiku, Qwen
   - Preferred for: More complex code tasks, initial problem analysis

3. **Tier 3 (Remote Heavyweight)**
   - Complex reasoning, architectural design, difficult debugging
   - Models: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4
   - Preferred for: Tasks requiring deep reasoning or cross-domain knowledge

## Code Style and Conventions

### Python

- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- 4 spaces for indentation
- Use docstrings for all functions and classes

### Comments

- Include brief comments for complex sections
- Add TODOs for future improvements
- Document any workarounds or tricky implementations

### Error Handling

- Use try/except blocks for operations that could fail
- Log errors with appropriate level (info, warning, error)
- Return meaningful error messages

### Commit Messages
