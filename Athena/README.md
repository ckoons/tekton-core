Athena is the knowledge management component of the Tekton ecosystem, providing structured knowledge representation, reasoning, and factual grounding for other components.

## Overview

Athena stores, manages, and provides access to structured knowledge in the form of a knowledge graph. It supports:

- Entity and relationship management
- Fact storage with provenance and confidence scoring
- Knowledge graph traversal and querying
- Multi-hop reasoning capabilities
- Temporal reasoning (handling facts that change over time)
- Integration with other Tekton components

## Architecture

Athena consists of the following key components:

- **Core Knowledge Engine**: Graph database integration and knowledge representation
- **Query Processing**: SPARQL/Cypher generation and multi-hop reasoning
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Extraction pipelines and validation workflows
- **API Layer**: REST and GraphQL interfaces for other components
- **Integration Services**: Connectors to other Tekton components

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.9+
- Neo4j for graph storage
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy for metadata management
- Pydantic for data validation

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourOrganization/Athena.git

# Install dependencies
cd Athena
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
from athena.core import KnowledgeEngine

# Initialize the knowledge engine
engine = KnowledgeEngine()

# Add entities and relationships
person_id = engine.add_entity("Person", {"name": "Alan Turing"})
field_id = engine.add_entity("Field", {"name": "Computer Science"})
engine.add_relationship(person_id, "CONTRIBUTED_TO", field_id, {
    "contribution": "Turing Machine",
    "year": 1936,
    "significance": "high"
})

# Query the knowledge graph
results = engine.query("MATCH (p:Person)-[r:CONTRIBUTED_TO]->(f:Field) RETURN p, r, f")

# Ask questions
answer = engine.ask("Who contributed to Computer Science?")
```

## Integration with Tekton

Athena integrates with other Tekton components:

- **Ergon**: Provides knowledge tools for agents
- **Engram**: Grounds memories with factual information
- **Future components**: Provides knowledge backbone for reasoning
