# Athena Development Plan

This document outlines the development plan for Athena, the knowledge graph component of the Tekton ecosystem.

## Core Architecture

Athena will consist of the following key components:

### 1. Knowledge Repository Layer

- **Graph Database Integration**
  - Primary: Neo4j with py2neo for Python integration
  - Alternative: In-memory networkx with SQLite persistence for simpler deployments
  - Factory pattern for choosing implementation

- **Knowledge Representation**
  - Entity-relationship model with typed entities and relationships
  - Support for properties on both entities and relationships
  - Provenance tracking for all knowledge assertions
  - Confidence scoring for facts
  - Temporal context for handling facts that change over time

### 2. Knowledge Processing Services

- **Entity Management**
  - Entity creation, update, retrieval, and deletion
  - Entity resolution and disambiguation
  - Entity linking with external knowledge bases

- **Relationship Management**
  - Relationship creation, update, retrieval, and deletion
  - Relationship inference
  - Path finding and graph traversal

- **Reasoning Capabilities**
  - Multi-hop reasoning for complex queries
  - Temporal reasoning for facts with time dimensions
  - Counterfactual analysis
  - Uncertainty handling

### 3. API Layer

- **REST API**
  - Entity and relationship CRUD operations
  - Graph querying endpoints
  - Question answering interface

- **GraphQL API**
  - Flexible graph querying
  - Complex traversals

- **Python SDK**
  - Native Python interface for other Tekton components

### 4. Integration Services

- **Engram Integration**
  - Fact verification for memories
  - Entity extraction from memories
  - Knowledge-grounded memory retrieval

- **Ergon Integration**
  - Knowledge tools for agents
  - Fact-checking capabilities

- **Future Component Integration**
  - Planning knowledge for Prometheus
  - Domain knowledge for specialized components

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Knowledge Repository Core

- Basic Neo4j integration
- Entity and relationship data models
- CRUD operations for entities and relationships
- Simple Cypher query execution

### Phase 2: Knowledge API Layer

- REST API for basic operations
- GraphQL for complex queries
- Python SDK for programmatic access

### Phase 3: Knowledge Processing

- Entity resolution and disambiguation
- Path finding and graph traversal
- Basic reasoning capabilities

### Phase 4: Integration Services

- Engram integration for memory grounding
- Ergon integration for agent knowledge tools
- Specialized domain knowledge subgraphs

### Phase 5: Advanced Reasoning

- Multi-hop reasoning
- Temporal reasoning
- Counterfactual analysis
- Uncertainty handling

## Technical Considerations

### Database Selection

Neo4j is recommended as the primary graph database for several reasons:

- Mature and widely used
- Excellent Python integration
- ACID compliance
- Rich query language (Cypher)
- Support for property graphs

Alternative implementations can include:

- NetworkX for simpler in-memory graphs
- SQLite for persistence in smaller deployments
- RDFLib for triple store capabilities

### API Design

The API will follow RESTful principles with these endpoints:

- `/entities` - Entity management
- `/relationships` - Relationship management
- `/query` - Cypher query execution
- `/ask` - Natural language question answering

GraphQL will provide a flexible query interface for complex graph traversals.

### Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling for database access
- Caching frequently accessed entities and relationships
- Optimized query planning
- Batch operations for efficiency

### Security Considerations

- Authentication and authorization for API access
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Knowledge Domains

Initial implementation will focus on these knowledge domains:

1. **AI/ML Concepts**
   - ML algorithms, techniques, and frameworks
   - AI research papers and concepts
   - Tool capabilities and constraints

2. **Technical Documentation**
   - System components and relationships
   - Dependency networks
   - API specifications

3. **General Knowledge Base**
   - Basic facts about the world
   - Common entities and relationships
   - Temporal facts

## Future Extensions

- **Visual Graph Explorer**: Web-based interface for exploring the knowledge graph
- **Knowledge Acquisition Pipelines**: Automated extraction from documents
- **Federated Knowledge Graphs**: Distribution across multiple databases
- **Knowledge Version Control**: Tracking changes to the knowledge base over time
- **Ontology Management**: Tools for defining and managing ontologies
