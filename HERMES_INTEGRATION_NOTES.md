# Hermes Integration Notes

## Current Status

We have successfully fixed the Hermes component launch in Tekton by properly launching the Hermes API server. The API server now starts correctly and listens on port 8100, providing access to registration, database, and messaging services.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Missing API Server (Fixed)**:
   - Previously, only the internal components (DatabaseManager and ServiceRegistry) were being initialized
   - These components were running as background processes but not exposing any API endpoints
   - We've updated the launch script to directly start the Hermes API server

2. **Port Configuration (Fixed)**:
   - Added explicit port configuration for the API server (8100) and Database MCP (8101)
   - Properly set environment variables for the API server to use

3. **Process Verification (Fixed)**:
   - Added proper verification of the API server process
   - Added API health check to confirm the server is responding

## Changes Implemented

1. **API Server Launch**:
   - Modified the Hermes launch function to start the API server directly from app.py
   - Set appropriate environment variables including PORT, HOST, and HERMES_DATA_DIR
   - Added fallback to separate components if the API server script is not found

2. **Health Check**:
   - Added a health check using curl to verify the API server is responding
   - Added better error reporting with log file checks

3. **Improved Robustness**:
   - The launch script now tries multiple approaches to launching Hermes
   - Better error handling and logging for troubleshooting

## Testing Results

1. **API Endpoints**:
   - Root endpoint (`/`) returns welcome message with API documentation link
   - Health endpoint (`/api/health`) confirms the service is healthy

2. **Component Integration**:
   - Verified that all components start correctly
   - API server, database manager, and service registry are all running

## API Usage

The Hermes API provides several key endpoints:

1. **Registration API**:
   - Register a component: POST `/api/register`
   - Send heartbeat: POST `/api/heartbeat`
   - Unregister a component: POST `/api/unregister`
   - Query services: POST `/api/query`

2. **Database API**:
   - Will be implemented in future updates
   - Will provide access to vector, graph, and document databases

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Complete API Implementation**:
   - Implement database API endpoints for accessing different database types
   - Add proper authentication and security mechanisms

2. **Database MCP Integration**:
   - Fix the database MCP server start in app.py
   - Update the scripts/run_database_mcp.py script path

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Add more robust error handling in the API server
   - Add proper error codes and messages for different failure scenarios

4. **Documentation**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Document all available endpoints and their parameters

5. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test with other Tekton components like Engram
   - Ensure proper component registration and discovery
