# Session 11: Telos Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the Telos component for Tekton, focusing on architecture decisions, integration points, and challenges encountered.

## Implementation Overview

The Telos component provides comprehensive requirements management, tracing, and validation capabilities for the Tekton ecosystem. It follows the Tekton Single Port Architecture pattern, offering a unified interface for requirements management via HTTP, WebSocket, and event-based communication.

Key features implemented:

1. **Requirements Management**: Create, update, organize, and track project requirements
2. **Hierarchical Requirements**: Support for parent-child relationships in requirements
3. **Requirement Tracing**: Bidirectional tracing between requirements for impact analysis
4. **Requirement Validation**: Quality checking for requirements based on clarity, completeness, testability, feasibility, and consistency
5. **Prometheus Integration**: Advanced planning capabilities based on requirements
6. **LLM-Enhanced Analysis**: Integration with Rhetor's LLM capabilities for improved requirement analysis
7. **Single Port Architecture**: All operations through port 8008 with path-based routing
8. **CLI Interface**: Comprehensive command-line tools for requirement management
9. **REST API**: Full-featured API for programmatic integration
10. **WebSocket Support**: Real-time updates for collaborative requirement editing

## Architecture and Design Patterns

### Single Port Architecture

Telos implements the Tekton Single Port Architecture pattern, using port 8008 for all communications:

- **HTTP API** (`/api/*`): RESTful endpoints for requirements management
- **WebSocket** (`/ws`): Real-time updates and collaborative editing
- **Events** (future): Server-sent events for notifications

### API Design

The API follows a resource-oriented RESTful design with these key endpoints:

- Projects: `/api/projects/*` - CRUD operations for projects
- Requirements: `/api/projects/{project_id}/requirements/*` - CRUD for requirements
- Traces: `/api/projects/{project_id}/traces/*` - Bidirectional relationships
- Validation: `/api/projects/{project_id}/validate` - Quality assessment
- Planning: `/api/projects/{project_id}/plan` - Prometheus integration

All endpoints accept and return JSON, with appropriate HTTP status codes for success/error cases.

### Domain Model

The core domain model consists of:

1. **Project**: Container for requirements
2. **Requirement**: Individual requirement with attributes like title, description, priority, etc.
3. **Trace**: Bidirectional relationship between requirements (e.g., depends-on, implements, refines)
4. **Validation Results**: Quality metrics and improvement suggestions

### Integration Points

Telos integrates with several Tekton components:

1. **Hermes**: Service registration and discovery
   - Registers capabilities as a requirements management service
   - Advertises API endpoints and WebSocket availability

2. **Prometheus**: Planning and task breakdown
   - Sends requirements for analysis and planning
   - Receives planning suggestions for implementation

3. **Rhetor**: LLM-powered requirement analysis
   - Uses LLM for advanced requirement quality assessment
   - Provides intelligent improvement suggestions

4. **Hephaestus**: UI integration
   - Embeds as a shadow DOM component in the Tekton UI
   - Provides interactive requirement management interface

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Implementation

The backend is implemented using FastAPI with async/await patterns:

```python
# Core components
- telos/core/requirements_manager.py  # Central management of requirements
- telos/core/project.py               # Project model and operations
- telos/core/requirement.py           # Requirement model and operations

# API Layer
- telos/api/app.py                    # FastAPI application with all endpoints
- telos/api/__init__.py               # API module initialization

# Rhetor Integration
- telos/ui/analyzers.py               # LLM-powered requirement analysis
```

### CLI Implementation

The CLI provides an interactive interface for requirement management:

```python
- telos/ui/cli.py                     # Main CLI entry point
- telos/ui/cli_parser.py              # Command-line argument parsing
- telos/ui/cli_commands.py            # Command implementations
- telos/ui/interactive_refine.py      # Interactive requirement refinement
```

### LLM Integration

A key feature is the Rhetor LLM integration for requirement analysis:

```python
# Direct LLM client usage
try:
    from rhetor.core.llm_client import LLMClient
    self.llm_client = LLMClient()
    await self.llm_client.initialize()
    return await self._analyze_with_direct_llm(requirement)
except ImportError:
    # Fallback to Rhetor client
    from rhetor.client import get_rhetor_prompt_client
    self.rhetor_client = await get_rhetor_prompt_client()
    return await self._analyze_with_rhetor(requirement)
```

This provides a graceful fallback mechanism when direct LLM access isn't available.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Balancing Standalone Operation with Integration

**Challenge**: Telos needed to function both as a standalone component and as an integrated part of the Tekton ecosystem.

**Solution**: Implemented a layered architecture with:
- Core domain logic independent of integration points
- Adapter layer for Hermes, Prometheus, and Rhetor
- Graceful degradation when dependent components are unavailable

### Challenge 2: LLM Integration for Requirement Analysis

**Challenge**: Leveraging LLM capabilities without hard dependencies.

**Solution**: Created a dual-path integration with Rhetor:
1. Direct `LLMClient` usage when available
2. Rhetor client as fallback
3. Rule-based analysis as final fallback

This ensures Telos can always analyze requirements, even without LLM access.

### Challenge 3: Single Port Architecture Compliance

**Challenge**: Adapting multiple communication patterns to a single port.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented path-based routing in FastAPI
- Created separate endpoint handlers for HTTP vs WebSocket
- Ensured consistent error handling across protocols
- Used environment variables for port configuration

### Challenge 4: Real-time Collaborative Features

**Challenge**: Implementing WebSocket for real-time updates.

**Solution**:
- Created a client registration and subscription model
- Added project-specific event channels
- Implemented real-time broadcasting of changes
- Built client-side reconnection handling

## Testing Approach

Testing for Telos focused on these key areas:

1. **Core Domain Logic**: Unit tests for Project and Requirement models
2. **API Endpoints**: Integration tests for FastAPI routes
3. **LLM Integration**: Tests with simulated LLM responses
4. **WebSocket Communication**: Tests for real-time updates
5. **CLI Functionality**: End-to-end tests for command-line operations

## UI Component

The UI component is implemented as a Shadow DOM component for Hephaestus, with these features:

1. **Project Dashboard**: Overview of all projects and their requirements
2. **Requirement Board**: Kanban-style view of requirements by status
3. **Requirement Detail**: Detailed view of individual requirements
4. **Trace Visualization**: Graph visualization of requirement relationships
5. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based collaboration
