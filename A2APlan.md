Based on your requirements for a focused A2A integration without adding extensive new security features,
  here's the streamlined implementation plan:

  A2A Integration Plan for Tekton

  Phase 1: Core A2A Protocol Support in Hermes

  1. Extend Hermes with A2A Server Endpoints
    - Implement core A2A JSON-RPC endpoints in Hermes
    - Add task lifecycle management (tasks/send, tasks/get, etc.)
    - Utilize existing Hermes messaging infrastructure as backend
  2. Adapt Existing Authentication
    - Use Tekton's current token-based authentication system
    - Add minimal support for A2A's required authentication schemes
    - Implement JWT validation for A2A push notifications
  3. Agent Card Implementation
    - Create a standardized Agent Card template for Tekton components
    - Generate /.well-known/agent.json endpoints for each component
    - Include capabilities, supported authentication schemes, and endpoint info

  Phase 2: Component-to-Protocol Mapping

  1. Task-to-Message Mapping Layer
    - Create adapters between Tekton's internal message format and A2A tasks
    - Implement translation of message parts and content types
    - Develop state machine for A2A task lifecycle management
  2. Capability-to-Skill Mapping
    - Define mapping between Tekton component capabilities and A2A skills
    - Create schema definitions for Tekton-specific skills
    - Build bidirectional capability resolver in Hermes
  3. Message Streaming Support
    - Implement SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses
    - Add streaming support to Hermes messaging system
    - Create client adapters for consuming streaming A2A content

  Phase 3: Discovery and Registration

  1. Internal Component Discovery
    - Enhance Hermes's Registration Manager to generate A2A agent cards
    - Create automatic capability-to-skill translation during registration
    - Implement agent card caching and invalidation
  2. External Agent Registration
    - Add external A2A agent registration interface to Hermes
    - Implement agent card fetching and validation
    - Create storage for external agent metadata
  3. Discoverability Implementation
    - Add HTTP OPTIONS support for agent discovery
    - Implement well-known URL patterns for agent cards
    - Create A2A directory integration points (for future expansion)

  Phase 4: Task Orchestration

  1. Prometheus Enhancement for A2A Routing
    - Add skill analysis to Prometheus's planning engine
    - Implement A2A-aware task decomposition
    - Create routing rules based on skill matching
  2. Skill-Based Task Assignment
    - Develop priority algorithms for agent selection based on skills
    - Implement performance tracking for skill execution
    - Create fallback mechanisms for skill routing
  3. User Preference Management
    - Add storage for agent routing preferences
    - Implement override mechanisms for manual agent selection
    - Create UI/CLI interfaces for preference management

  Technical Implementation Considerations

  1. Minimize Protocol Extensions
    - Stick to core A2A protocol without extensive customization
    - Use existing A2A mechanisms where possible
    - Implement Tekton-specific features at application layer, not protocol layer
  2. Leverage Existing Infrastructure
    - Use Hermes's messaging bus for A2A task distribution
    - Utilize current authentication mechanisms with minimal adaptation
    - Keep security implementation focused on A2A requirements only
  3. Separate Cost Management
    - Build cost tracking outside the A2A protocol layer
    - Implement resource tracking independently of task messaging
    - Create simple interfaces between cost management and task routing

  Initial Implementation Steps

  1. Create A2A Protocol Reference Implementation
    - Build basic A2A client/server in Hermes
    - Implement minimal task lifecycle management
    - Add simple agent card generation
  2. Develop Component Adapter Pattern
    - Create reusable adapter pattern for Tekton components
    - Implement base classes for A2A compatibility
    - Build examples with one or two components (start with Ergon)
  3. Extend Registration Protocol
    - Update Hermes registration protocol to include A2A-specific data
    - Create utility methods for component A2A registration
    - Implement automatic agent card generation during registration

  This focused approach follows your requested constraints while implementing the core functionality needed
   for A2A integration. The implementation leverages Tekton's existing architecture and adds only the
